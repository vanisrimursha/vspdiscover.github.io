<h2>Course Objective…</h2><br>
•To learn how to identify, organize and build a new enterprise.<br>
•We don’t just study entrepreneurs, we become entrepreneurs.<br>

<h2>Beginning of Business Plan</h2><br>
•Trying to accomplish? Wiring of America<br>
•To be done? Transmission and distribution<br>
•Protect the IP? Yes & how.<br>
•Market size? 50 million U.S. population/13 million households plus businesses - about the same overseas<br>
•Competition? Kerosene lamps, SOSO, etc. What people will you need? #’s, skills, location<br>
•What’s your sales model? SaaS<br>
•Time to ramp up? Years<br>
•How much capital? Millions but start small<br>

<h2>Identify why this is an Exceptional Opportunity</h2><br>
•There are many opportunities within the idea; job is to pick one & focus - explain why & growth strategy.<br>
•Should you go into the transmission business? Distribution? Equipment?<br>
•Must concentrate attack to increase chance of success with limited resources<br>
•Now why is this so interesting & exciting?<br>
•Numbers!<br>
•You would deal with a list of problems that you would have to address. How serious is each problem? When would you have to address the problem?<br>
•You would detail what are the risks in your plan - technological and market - and how you would reduce risks.<br>
•You would detail who the stakeholders would be, and your value proposition to each one.<br>
•You would understand a typical sales call.<br>
•How do you know as quickly as possible if this is a good business?<br>


<h2>Analyze the Demand</h2><br>
•What are the sales of whale oil? Natural gas?<br>
•What are the problems of candles?<br>
•What is the size and shape of the existing market?<br>
•What are the problems with the current (joke) way of lighting?<br>
•What are the advantages of your system?<br>


<h2>Our New Enterprises Class...</h2><br>
•Cram as much experience into 13 weeks as possible.<br>
•Goal: Have a business plan built that will yield a company with a market capitalization of $30 million within three years of launch/or sales of $10 million.<br>
•Cases and readings are important, but the idea is to pick up lessons and insights.<br>
•Learn by doing<br>


<h2>Why Start a Company?</h2><br>
1.Control your own destiny – beg vs. create awesome job<br>
2.Attackers vs. Defenders: Attackers make all the money & have all the fun, e.g., Zuckerberg, Brin, Jobs<br>
3.Starting companies is LESS risky than thought, and so much more rewarding<br>
4.Change the world<br>
5.The Best Reason: Nothing will use your talents more than starting a company!<br>


<h2>Survivor: Grades</h2><br>
At end of semester, the plan gets a grade.<br>
•A+ = a plan of the quality that an angel investor/venture capitalist would fund<br>
•A = a plan that an angel investor/venture capitalist would at least put on the active list<br>
•A- = a plan where the angel/venture capitalist would take the first meeting<br>
•B = a plan that an investor would refer to a fellow investor who he/she held in minimal high regard<br>
•C = no brainer turndown (NBTD)<br>

<h2>Recruiting Advisors</h2><br>
•Us grading/reading your assignments is not sufficient.<br>
•Students often say, at the end of the semester, “we wish we got more feedback on our assignments”.<br>
•Up to you to be more proactive in seeking guidance (ours & others).<br>
•Assignments will be scanned for the essentials, and randomly checked in-depth.<br>
•Strongly recommend that you use the EIRs at the Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.<br>

<div id="c2" class="tabcontent">
<h2>Why Do a Financial Plan?</h2><br>
•“The numbers are meaningless”<br>
•“It will all change anyway”<br>
•“They all look the same”<br>
•“The investors are just going to basically ignore it and redo it so what is the point?”<br>

<h2>B-Plan Financials – Nuts & Bolts</h2><br>
•The financials determine whether your business plan is viable<br>
•Key components<br>
Income Statement (Profit & Loss)<br>
Cashflow<br>
Balance Sheet<br>
Assumptions Summary<br>
Sensitivity Analysis – high, medium, low probability of key assumptions<br>
Selective market metrics – average revenue per customer, inventory turn, etc.<br>

<h2>Financials Should Reflect Milestones</h2><br>
•Align financing needs with milestones – raise enough capital to get you beyond each milestone<br>
•Show what you need to raise to meet each milestone, what it will be used for and how far will it take you<br>

<h2>Financials Must Relate to Market Assumptions</h2><br>
•Sales Growth should track with Addressable Market<br>
•Market share should make sense with competitors’ share<br>
•Pricing should be relevant to market<br>
•Costs should compare with market<br>
•Economics should be compelling<br>

<h2>How to build a financial model</h2><br>
1.Get the top line model built<br>
A.Assumptions Clear<br>
B.Flexible<br>
C.Show ties to milestones<br>
2.Build up your COGS<br>
3.Build up your costs in general<br>
4.Build a P&L Statement (a/k/a Profit & Loss, Income)<br>
5.Cash Flow is what matters<br>
6.Graphical summary<br>
7.Sensitivity<br>
8.Make all major assumptions clear<br>


<h2>Income Statement Assumptions</h2><br>
•Revenue = Units x Price<br>
What is your sales unit (device, subscription, royalty, etc)<br>
How are you determining price<br>
•Cost of Revenue = Units x Cost to Produce<br>
How much does it cost to produce a sales unit<br>
•Materials, Labor or both<br>
•Operating Expenses<br>
Salaries, Commissions & Benefits<br>
Rent & Utilities<br>
Marketing, Tradeshow, Advertising<br>
Insurance<br>
Travel & Entertainment<br>
Research & Development<br>
Recruiting<br>
Shipping<br>
Repairs & Maintenance<br>
Fees<br>
Office Expense<br>
Website<br>

<h2>Cost of Goods Sold</h2><br>
•What is your cost of goods sold?<br>
Only costs directly associated with producing your product or service<br>
•BOM - Bill of Material<br>
•Direct Labor<br>
•Other Direct Costs<br>
Not fixed costs – Insurance, telephone, etc.<br>
Not marketing costs<br>

<h2>Breakeven Analysis</h2><br>
•“Breakeven is defined when total sales equal the total costs”<br>
•Is that what really matters?<br>
•Cash flow breakeven is what really matters!<br>

<h2>Ownership Discussion/Section for Class Project</h2><br>
•This is not a legal document but rather an academic exercise<br>
•We want you to go through the exercise even if you make up the numbers to start<br>
•Learn how dilution happens and ownership gets split up<br>
•Remember, this is just an learing exercise and is in no way binding<br>

<div id="c3" class="tabcontent">
<h2>1. Start with the mainstream of your existing or expected customer base.</h2><br>
•Example: Diplomats at the Radiological Society of North America who run community hospitals in the United States with over 500 beds.<br><br>
•At a certain point, you have to FREEZE the design… or you will never ship.<br>

<h2>2. You have to eventually split your development team into enhancements/new products.</h2><br>
•If all your effort is in enhancements, then you will be too late with a new product<br>
•If all your effort is in the new product, you leave room for your competition.<br>

<h2>3. You only have a certain number of Very Good Technical People</h2><br>
•Demands:<br>
A. Make a version for the European market; get certification.<br>
B. Work with a big OEM so that your product works with his.<br>
C. Put in the five features that you promised to your biggest customers by next quarter and test<br>
D. Redesign the product so that it can be made 40% cheaper in an overseas factory.<br>
E. Take the product and simplify it for the Indian/Chinese market.<br>
F. Take the technology and repackage it for the security market…<br>

<h2>In the end, you need a product roadmap.</h2><br>
1.What enhancements will you do… and when? What is the cost?<br>
2.What MAJOR upgrades will you be doing?<br>
3.When will you come with a Major redesign? What will be<br>
the specifications?<br>

<h2>Options in Sales/Distribution</h2><br>
1.Start a Direct Sales Operation<br>
2.Sell through Restaurant IT Companies<br>
3.OEM with IBM/NCR/Other<br>
4.Go through Distributors<br>


<h2>Each method has its strengths and weaknesses</h2><br>
•Each depends on the Selling Price of the Product<br>
•Each depends on the adoption cycle<br>
•Each depends on the degree of change for the consumer of the product<br>
•Each depends on the profitability of the product<br>


<h2>Direct Sales
+’s</h2><br>
•Allows control of salesforce<br>
•Target customer<br>
•Best for products that can get $20,000 - $50,000 per customer per year<br>

<h2>OEM
-’s</h2><br>
•May take long time: evaluation, negotiation.<br>
•Will require 40% of sales – a $25,000 product will only get you $15,000<br>
•Will lose brand; OEM gets<br>
•May lose out on next product<br>
•Will require sales people to help get early sales anyway<br>

<h2>Retail:</h2><br>
•Can give nationwide, even worldwide distribution.<br>
•Appropriate for products at lower price point<br>
•Retailer will want 25 – 35%. Plus advertising, plus stocking charge<br>
•Retailer will need training.<br>
•Retailer may have competing products, including his own.<br>
•No guarantee of sales. May want exclusive<br>

<h2>The Keys To Success with this Process</h2>
All of the following analysis must be done by deeply engaging with potential real customers with an open mind (not selling to them) and carefully listening to what they say and what is really meant. Getting strong relationships with potential customers and really understanding their needs and the value you can bring them is the real gold in this process. Of course you need strong analytic skills and a fast clock speed to get this done but usually it is the last of on going honest customer dialogue that undermines the value of this process.</p>
<p>
<h2>Step #1: Market Evaluation</h2>
Systematically identify and evaluate the top market opportunities. This generally is a long process but it is important to not let it go on indefinitely. There will likely be many paths to success and it is important that you choose one but not necessarily the perfect one. There likely is no perfect one. It is better to try a market and find out if it will work out and learn that it will not rather than be a state of “analysis paralysis”. Set a reasonable time frame and aggressively explore multiple markets in an exploratory fashion (not a sales manner) with primary open mind market research techniques.</p>
<p>
<h2>Step #2: Select One Beach Head Market</h2>
After a sufficient period of evaluation, choose one opportunities and pursue it with great focus. It does not have to be the biggest opportunity or clearly the best opportunity, but it does have to be a beach head application with sufficient size, profitability and significance that when you win it, it will produce positive cash flow for the venture and position the company well for the future.
</p>
<h2>Step #3: How to Chose Beachhead Segment</h2>
1.Is the target customer well funded & readily accessible to our sales force?<br>
2.Do they have a compelling reason to buy?<br>
3.Can we today, with the help of partners, deliver a whole product?<br>
4.Is there entrenched competition that could block us?<br>
5.If we win this segment, can we leverage it to enter additional segments?<br>
6.Can we show results in an acceptable timeframe?/,br>
<p><h2>Step #4: TAM Sizing for 1st Market</h2>
Make a first pass TAM (Total Addressable Market) calculation on this first market. This is how much annual revenue there is available to you for your product if you achieved 100% market share. This is only for your first “beach head” market which you should be able to do with some clarity. The strong preference is for a bottoms up type of analysis where you can show from your primary market research how many of the potential customer you have identified and then extrapolate this to the broader market. Complementary to this but much less compelling on its own, is a tops down analysis where you are working with market analysis reports and extrapolating without direct interaction and validation. Often, very important subtleties are missed in tops down analysis.
</p>
<p><h2>Step #5: Persona</h2>
Build a Persona that very clearly and viscerally visualizes the target customer decision maker/end user to all involved. The Persona should not just be a factual description of the buyer but also social and emotional factors such as what incents them, their priorities, what they fear, what industry groups they belong to and other systemic factors that will influence the purchase and adoption of your product. Your persona should be a real person but also representative of the broader market so that if you meet the persona’s need, the others will be equally pleased.
</p>
<p><h2>Step #6: Use Case</h2>
Develop and step through in detail an illustrative and pretty standard Use Case for the need, acquisition and benefits of your offering. It is extremely important to go all the way through a use case with your target customer of first how your product/service will work for the target customer. How exactly does it fit into the value chain? What are the key interface points? Why exactly would they acquire it? What barriers to adoption might arise? It is also important to extend your use case to not just how the target customer would use your product but then to the wider acquisition and post installation support process.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Step #9: First 10 Target Customer List</h2>
Now that you understand your customers well and you have a use case and value proposition, make a list of the Top 10 Target Customers that will benefit from your product after you sell it to the first one from the persona you described above. Hopefully you have already spoken to these customers and you have some level of commitment from them to acquire, test or pilot your product once it is available.

B. Is Late<br>
C. Is the wrong product (and is late or doesn’t work)<br>
•MOST products are late... Now HOW late is it? Beta due out 1/1, Production: 6/1v
•Pressure to Ship; Ship with bugs; no product ships bug free.<br>
•Your problem: you do NOT know how big a problem you have... So you don’t know WHEN it will be fixed<br>

<h2>What are the iterations?</h2><br>
•Priced OK, market wants a different product<br>
•Priced too high; market will still take the product<br>
•Priced wrong, product wrong<br>
•Options:<br>
•Finish product now, redirect R&D for next product<br>
•Abandon product now; start R&D for new product now, cut sales, cut everything; RESTART<br>
• Raise more money<br>


<h2>Problem Key Employees Leave</h2><br>
A. Sales under goals<br>
B. Product late; wrong product<br>
C. Hot economy<br>
•This is going to happen. Demoralizing. Evidence of bad vision. Downward spiral.<br>
•Is this necessarily a bad thing? Addition by Subtraction.<br>
•Assume it is bad: What to do?<br>
•Find out WHY they are leaving
Stress <br>
Psychologically unsuitable for startup<br>

<h2>Why leaving?</h2><br>
•Better offer?Too much responsibility? Not enough money? Equity? Security?<br>
•Do you have an adequate backup to that person now? If not:<br>
how long to fill that spot?<br>
Who can fill in during short term?<br>
•Your odds of changing person’s mind: 25%. Even if they stay, assume 50% that they may be gone within a year. If they stay, immediately hire backup.<br>

<h2>If they are going...</h2><br>
•Get immediate commitment that they will not hire others. Send legal letter.<br>
•If they are leaving, much better if company is on upward spiral.<br>
•Think through disaster control<br>

<h2>Conclusions...</h2><br>
•Keep vague: new investor, OEM deal, new talent… until it is on<br>
•tell your lead investor..”we will run out of money in 90 days..”; he needs time to tell his partners, contingencies<br>
•Bridge loan. New investors. He has seen this dozens of times; you once. He wants to keep you going; he can bridge, raise money, do merger, arrange bank financing. He needs time….stick with it<br></p>
