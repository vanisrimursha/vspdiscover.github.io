<h2>Personal Skills Defined</h2>
Are you the first person your friends come to when they need advice? Do you tend to speak up in groups and easily share your ideas? If you answered yes, then you can count interpersonal skills and leadership as two of your personal skills. These types of skills can be abilities we are born with, our natural talents, or things we develop through our experiences and deliberate practice. Whether an innate aptitude or a developed capability, knowing what our own personal skills are is very useful in both our personal and professional lives.

<h2>Soft And Hard Skills</h2>
Before we can truly answer what a personal skill is, we must first define what a skill is in general. A skill is the ability to do something well, a certain competence or proficiency. Skills are typically acquired or developed through direct experiences and training, and they can require sustained effort. Therefore, personal skills are simply those skills that you possess and consider your strengths. But how do we know what these are?

To answer this question, you can categorize personal skills in two ways: soft and hard skills. Soft skills are more general, intangible qualities or attributes we possess that enhance our interactions with others. They can be related to our attitude, personality, emotions, habits, communication style, and social manners. Successful development of soft skills happens during our interactions with others (family, friends, and co-workers) and are fundamental to how well we build and manage our relationships.

In contrast, hard skills are more specific and are often associated with a task or activity, most times job-related. They include certain abilities and knowledge about an area of focus and can be easily quantified and evaluated. Mostly learned through education, training, and on-the-job experience, hard skills can include computer literacy, project management, editing, or proficiency in a foreign language. These types of skills make us employable and allow us to tackle our job responsibilities. Soft and hard skills complement each other and make up our arsenal of personal skills that demonstrate our capabilities.

<h2>Examples</h2>
If you have ever played a sport, you have used both soft and hard skills to perform well. Let's assume you play soccer for a community league. Perhaps the most obvious skill necessary is being a team player or the ability to work with others towards a common goal. In this case, a big win. However, we can't achieve a big win without also tapping on our hard skills. In this scenario, hard skills are considered those we use to actually play the sport, such as the ability to kick the ball or score a goal. While hard skills require a certain precision that is repeatable, soft skills rely heavily on recognition and flexibility.</p>

<h2>Overview of Personal Skill</h2>
<p>Among other things, personal development may include the following activities:<br>

•	improving self-awareness<br>

•	improving self-knowledge<br>

•	improving skills and/or learning new ones<br>

•	building or renewing identity/self-esteem<br>
•	developing strengths or talents<br>
•	improving a career<br>
•	identifying or improving potential<br>
•	building employability or (alternatively) human capital<br>
•	enhancing lifestyle and/or the quality of life and time-management<br>
•	improving health<br>
•	improving wealth or social status<br>
•	fulfilling aspirations<br>
•	initiating a life enterprise<br>
•	defining and executing personal development plans (PDPs)<br>
•	improving social relations or emotional intelligence<br>
Personal development can also include developing other people. This may take place through roles such as those of a teacher or mentor, either through a personal competency (such as the alleged skill of certain managers in developing the potential of employees) or through a professional service (such as providing training, assessment or coaching).
Beyond improving oneself and developing others, "personal development" labels a field of practice and research:<br>
•	As a field of practice, personal development includes personal-development methods, learning programs, assessment systems, tools, and techniques.<br>
•	As a field of research, personal-development topics appear in psychology journals, education research, management journals and books, and human-development economics.
Any sort of development—whether economic, political, biological, organisational or personal—requires a framework if one wishes to know whether a change has actually occurred.[3][need quotation to verify] In the case of personal development, an individual often functions as the primary judge of improvement or of regression, but validation of objective improvement requires assessment using standard criteria. Personal-development frameworks may include:<br>
•	goals or benchmarks that define the end-points<br>
•	strategies or plans for reaching goals<br>
•	measurement and assessment of progress, levels or stages that define milestones along a development path<br>
•	a feedback system to provide information on changes<br>

  <h2>Personal Development In Industry</h2>
<p>Personal development as an industry has several business relationship formats of operating. The main ways are business-to-consumer and business-to-business. However, there are two newer ways increasing in prevalence: consumer-to-business and consumer-to-consumer.
<h2>Business-to-consumer market</h2><br>
The business-to-consumer market involves selling books, courses and techniques to individuals, such as:<br>
newly invented offerings such as:<br>
•	fitness<br>
•	beauty enhancement<br>
•	weight loss<br>
traditional practices such as:<br>
•	yoga<br>
•	martial arts<br>
•	meditation<br>
Some programs are delivered online and many include tools sold with a program, such as motivational books for self-help, recipes for weight-loss or technical manuals for yoga and martial-arts programs.
A partial list of personal development offerings on the business-to-individual market might include:<br>
•	books<br>
•	motivational speaking<br>
•	e-Learning programs<br>
•	workshops<br>
•	individual counseling<br>
•	life coaching<br>
•	Time Management<br>

<h2>Business-to-business market</h2><br>
The business-to-business market also involves programs – in this case ones sold to companies and to governments to assess potential, to improve effectiveness, to manage work-life balance or to prepare some entity for a new role in an organization. The goals of these programs are defined[by whom?] with the institution or by the institution and the results are assessed.[by whom?][citation needed] Universities and business schools also contract programs to external specialist firms or to individuals.[citation needed]
A partial list of business-to-business programs might include:<br>
•	marketing and market development<br>
•	time management<br>
•	courses and assessment systems for higher education organizations for their students<br>
management services to employees in organizations through:<br>
•	training<br>
•	training and development programs<br>
•	personal-development tools<br>
•	self-assessment<br>
•	feedback<br>
•	business coaching<br>
•	mentoring<br>
Some consulting firms specialize in personal developmentbut as of 2009 generalist firms operating in the fields of human resources, recruitment and organizational strategy have entered what they perceive as a growing market,not to mention smaller firms and self-employed professionals who provide consulting, training and coaching.
Additionally, the International Alliance for Personal Development Professionals (IAPDP), an international group launched in 2015 to support professionals in the self-help and personal development industry.

 <h2>Higher Education</h2>

<p>Personal development has been at the heart of education in the West in the form of the Greek philosophers and in the East with Confucius. Some people emphasize personal development as a part of higher education. Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin (since 1949: Humboldt University of Berlin) in 1810, made a statement interpretable[by whom?] as referring to personal development: … if there is one thing more than another which absolutely requires free activity on the part of the individual, it is precisely education, whose object it is to develop the individual.
During the 1960s a large increase in the number of students on American campuses led to research on the personal development needs of undergraduate students. Arthur Chickering defined seven vectors of personal development for young adults during their undergraduate years:<br>
1.	developing competence<br>
2.	managing emotions<br>
3.	achieving autonomy and interdependence<br>
4.	developing mature interpersonal relationships<br>
5.	establishing identity<br>
6.	developing purpose<br>
7.	developing integrity<br>

In the UK, personal development took a central place in university policy in 1997 when the Dearing Report declared that universities should go beyond academic teaching to provide students with personal development.[citation needed] In 2001 a Quality Assessment Agency for UK universities produced guidelines[26] for universities to enhance personal development as:<br>
* a structured and supported process undertaken by an individual to reflect upon their own learning, performance and / or achievement and to plan for their personal, educational and career development;<br>
* objectives related explicitly to student development; to improve the capacity of students to understand what and how they are learning, and to review, plan and take responsibility for their own learning<br>
In the 1990s, business schools began to set up specific personal-development programs for leadership and career orientation and in 1998 the European Foundation for Management Development set up the EQUIS accreditation system which specified that personal development must form part of the learning process through internships, working on team projects and going abroad for work or exchange programs.<br>
The first personal development certification required for business school graduation originated in 2002 as a partnership between Metizo,[27] a personal-development consulting firm, and the Euromed Management School[28] in Marseilles: students must not only complete assignments but also demonstrate self-awareness and achievement of personal-development competencies.<br>
As an academic department personal development has become[when?] a specific discipline, usually associated with business schools.[29] As an area of research, personal development draws on links to other academic disciplines:<br>
•	education for questions of learning and assessment<br>
•	psychology for motivation and personality<br>
•	sociology for identity and social networks<br>
•	economics for human capital and economic value<br>
•	philosophy for ethics and self-reflection<br>

<h2>Personal Development In Workspace</h2>

<p>Abraham Maslow (1908–1970), proposed a hierarchy of needs with self actualization at the top, defined as:<br> 
… the desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming.<br>
Since Maslow himself believed that only a small minority of people self-actualize—he estimated one percent his hierarchy of needs had the consequence that organizations came to regard self-actualization or personal development as occurring at the top of the organizational pyramid, while job security and good working conditions would fulfill the needs of the mass of employees.<br>
As organizations and labor markets became more global, responsibility for development shifted from the company to the individual. In 1999 management thinker Peter Drucker wrote in the Harvard Business Review:<br>
We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: if you've got ambition and smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies today aren't managing their employees' careers; knowledge workers must, effectively, be their own chief executive officers. It's up to you to carve out your place, to know when to change course, and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years.<br>
Management professors Sumantra Ghoshal of the London Business School and Christopher Bartlett of the Harvard Business School wrote in 1997 that companies must manage people individually and establish a new work contract.[33] On the one hand the company must allegedly recognize that personal development creates economic value: "market performance flows not from the omnipotent wisdom of top managers but from the initiative, creativity and skills of all employees".<br>
On the other hand, employees should recognize that their work includes personal development and "... embrace the invigorating force of continuous learning and personal development".<br>
The 1997 publication of Ghoshal's and Bartlett's Individualized Corporation corresponded to a change in career development from a system of predefined paths defined by companies, to a strategy defined by the individual and matched to the needs of organizations in an open landscape of possibilities.[citation needed] Another contribution to the study of career development came with the recognition that women's careers show specific personal needs and different development paths from men. The 2007 study of women's careers by Sylvia Ann Hewlett Off-Ramps and On-Ramps had a major impact on the way companies view careers.Further work on the career as a personal development process came from study by Herminia Ibarra in her Working Identity on the relationship with career change and identity change,indicating that priorities of work and lifestyle continually develop through life.<br>
Personal development programs in companies fall into two categories: the provision of employee benefits and the fostering of development strategies.<br>
Employee benefits have the purpose of improving satisfaction, motivation and loyalty.Employee surveys may help organizations find out personal-development needs, preferences and problems, and they use the results to design benefits programs.[citation needed] Typical programs in this category include:<br>
•	work-life balance<br>
•	time management<br>
•	stress management<br>
•	health programs<br>
•	counseling<br>
Many such programs resemble programs that some employees might conceivably pay for themselves outside work: yoga, sports, martial arts, money-management, positive psychology, NLP, etc.<br>
As an investment, personal development programs have the goal of increasing human capital or improving productivity, innovation or quality. Proponents actually see such programs not as a cost but as an investment with results linked to an organization's strategic development goals. Employees gain access to these investment-oriented programs by selection according to the value and future potential of the employee, usually defined in a talent management architecture including populations such as new hires, perceived high-potential employees, perceived key employees, sales staff, research staff and perceived future leaders.[citation needed] Organizations may also offer other (non-investment-oriented) programs to many or even all employees. Typical programs[which?] focus on career-development, personal effectiveness, teamwork, and competency-development. Personal development also forms an element in management tools such as personal development planning, assessing one's level of ability using a competency grid,or getting feedback from a 360 questionnaire filled in by colleagues at different levels in the organization.<br>
A common criticism surrounding personal development programs is that they are often treated as an arbitrary performance management tool to pay lip service to, but ultimately ignored. As such, many companies have decided to replace personal development programs with SMART Personal Development Objectives, which are regularly reviewed and updated.<br> 
Personal Development Objectives help employees achieve career goals and improve overall performance.<br>

<h1>Managing Your Personal Development</h1><br>
There are a number of steps to take in managing your personal development.<br>

<h2>1. Developing a Personal Vision</h2><br>
Personal development can simply be for fun. <br>
Most of us, however, find it easier to motivate ourselves to learn and improve if we have a purpose in doing so. Developing your personal vision - a clear idea of where you want to be in a few months or years, and why - is a crucial part of developing this purpose.<br>

<h2>2. Planning Your Personal Development</h2><br>

Once you are clear about where you want to be, you can start planning how to get there. Drawing up a personal development plan is not essential, but it does make the planning process more realistic.<br>


<h2>3. Starting the Improvement Process</h2><br>

There are a number of different ways in which you can learn and develop.<br>

Improving Performance – Some Specific Techniques explains some ways of learning, including a technique called expertise transfer.<br>

<h2>4. Recording Your Personal Development</h2><br>
It is often a good idea to keep a record of your personal development. By writing down key developments in your learning and development as and when they occur, you will be able to reflect on your successes at a later date.<br>

This reflection may well help to motivate you to learn more skills in the future. Try keeping a learning log or journal as you develop your skills and knowledge.<br>

<h2>5. Reviewing and Revising Personal Development Plans</h2><br>

Regularreview of your personal development plans, and your development activities, will ensure that you learn from what you have done. It will also ensure that your activities continue to move you towards your goals, and that your goals or vision remain relevant to you.<br>

  <h3>Looking after your mind</h3>
  <p>Looking after your mind is every bit as important as looking after your body in terms of maintaining your overall health.

A growing body of studies suggests, too, that many of the same things are important for physical and mental health. These factors include sleep, diet and exercise.

There is more about this on our page:
Keeping Your Mind Healthy.


But there is more to keeping your mind healthy than simply eating well and exercising. Increasingly, the suggestion is emerging that some form of self-reflection or meditation can be extremely helpful in maintaining a healthy balance in your mind.

<h3>Harnessing the power of your mind</h3>
The ‘placebo effect’ is the well-documented phenomenon that people can recover from illness simply because they think they are being treated with an effective drug.

It is perhaps the best known example of the mind affecting physical health. But there are many more, and you can learn more in our pages on:

Positive Thinking and Improving Self-Esteem.

<h3>Mind skills</h3>

This section, however, addresses particular skills that require you to use your mind, rather than overall approaches to change or improvement.

But two areas, in particular, require a developed ability to use your mind consciously: Creative Thinking and Memory Skills.

<h3>Managing common mental illness</h3>

However much you may look after your body, sometimes you become ill.

You catch colds, or even develop more serious illnesses. The same goes for your mind.

Some people are more prone to mental illness than others, but nobody is immune.

Considerable effort has recently been put into reducing the perceived stigma of mental illness, but many people still find it difficult to acknowledge that they are having problems

  <h2>Practical Steps to Personal Development</h2>
  <p>here are a number of things that are vital in supporting your personal development, including developing a vision of where you want to be, and planning how you are going to get there.

But alongside these, it is also helpful to take some simple but practical steps to change how you organise your life.

These changes, outlined on this page, will help to give you more time and space to manage your personal development activities. Without that, you may struggle to find the time and energy to improve your skills or study.<br>

<h3>Organising Your Time</h3>
If you are considering making changes in your life, finding additional time often poses a problem.<br>

It could be that the changes you are thinking of making are to ensure you have extra time to:<br>

Spend with your family.<br>
Spend on things you enjoy doing.<br>
Devote to your work.<br>
Devote to your education.<br>
Whatever the reason, looking at how you spend your time will encourage you to think of ways your time could be managed more effectively.<br>

<h3>Personal Curriculum Vitae (CV) or Resume</h3>
Drawing up a CV or résumé is not only necessary when applying for jobs, it can also be very useful for your own benefit and will help you appraise the skills you have gained through education, training, employment, voluntary work, leisure and other activities.<br>

In turn, a personal CV, will help to highlight skills that you should work on developing.<br>

There are numerous different ways of setting out and presenting a CV or résumé for the purpose of applying for a job – you should be very careful to include all relevant information and make sure your document is well written and well presented.

<h3>Overcoming Barriers to Learning a New Skill</h3>
Learning a new skill will broaden the opportunities open to you, at the same time as empowering you as an individual.

There are many things that prevent people from learning new skills, but these barriers may be overcome with some thought. These might include:

<h4>Lack of Confidence or Self-Esteem:</h4>

This is one of the greatest obstacles facing many individuals. However, if this is a problem, ask yourself if there is anyone who would support and help you to take the first steps towards learning a new skill. Often, once the first move is made then the greatest hurdle is overcome. Confidence increases as you develop new skills.

<h4>Economic Situation:</h4>

You may see your financial situation as a barrier to developing new skills, but this need not be the case.

The internet has lots of free pages and tools and resources that can help you develop specific skills, browse our pages for a comprehensive guide.

There may be courses offered in local schools, colleges or universities which are free or offered at a reduced rate for people on a low income. Distance-learning courses allow you to study at home, which can help to reduce the cost of learning. There may also be trust funds or charities that offer grants for people developing new skills in your area. It is even possible to learn a new skill with the aid of books from the local library.

Voluntary work can also provide an excellent opportunity for learning and developing new skills, as can being a member of a local group or society.

<h4>Family Commitments:</h4>

If you have family commitments that prevent you from having the time to learn a new skill, it may be possible for you to enlist the help of a friend or family member to give you a few free hours each week. Colleges and universities offering vocational training courses may also have free or subsidised crèche places.
