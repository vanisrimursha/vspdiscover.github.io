<h2>PC (Personal Computer)</h2>
<p>A PC can be defined as a small, relatively inexpensive computer designed for an individual user. PCs are based on the microprocessor technology that enables manufacturers to put an entire CPU on one chip. Businesses use personal computers for word processing, accounting, desktop publishing, and for running spreadsheet and database management applications. At home, the most popular use for personal computers is playing games and surfing the Internet.</p>
<p>Although personal computers are designed as single-user systems, these systems are normally linked together to form a network. In terms of power, now-a-days high-end models of the Macintosh and PC offer the same computing power and graphics capability as low-end workstations by Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell.</p>
<h2>Workstation</h2>
<p>Workstation is a computer used for engineering applications (CAD/CAM), desktop publishing, software development, and other such types of applications which require a moderate amount of computing power and relatively high quality graphics capabilities.</p>
<p>Workstations generally come with a large, high-resolution graphics screen, large amount of RAM, inbuilt network support, and a graphical user interface. Most workstations also have mass storage device such as a disk drive, but a special type of workstation, called diskless workstation, comes without a disk drive.</p>
<p>Common operating systems for workstations are UNIX and Windows NT. Like PC, workstations are also single-user computers like PC but are typically linked together to form a local-area network, although they can also be used as stand-alone systems.</p>
<h2>Minicomputer</h2>
<p>It is a midsize multi-processing system capable of supporting up to 250 users simultaneously.</p>
<h2>Mainframe</h2>
<p>Mainframe is very large in size and is an expensive computer capable of supporting hundreds or even thousands of users simultaneously. Mainframe executes many programs concurrently and supports many simultaneous execution of programs.</p>
<h2>Supercomputer</h2>
<p>Supercomputers are one of the fastest computers currently available. Supercomputers are very expensive and are employed for specialized applications that require immense amount of mathematical calculations (number crunching).</p>
<p>For example, weather forecasting, scientific simulations, (animated) graphics, fluid dynamic calculations, nuclear energy research, electronic design, and analysis of geological data (e.g. in petrochemical prospecting).</p>

</table>
<h2>Mouse</h2>
<p>Mouse is the most popular pointing device. It is a very famous cursor-control device having a small palm size box with a round ball at its base, which senses the movement of the mouse and sends corresponding signals to the CPU when the mouse buttons are pressed.</p>
<p>Generally, it has two buttons called the left and the right button and a wheel is present between the buttons. A mouse can be used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, but it cannot be used to enter text into the computer.</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Not very expensive</li>
<li>Moves the cursor faster than the arrow keys of the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Joystick</h2>
<p>Joystick is also a pointing device, which is used to move the cursor position on a monitor screen. It is a stick having a spherical ball at its both lower and upper ends. The lower spherical ball moves in a socket. The joystick can be moved in all four directions.</p>
<p>The function of the joystick is similar to that of a mouse. It is mainly used in Computer Aided Designing (CAD) and playing computer games.</p>
<h2>Light Pen</h2>
<p>Light pen is a pointing device similar to a pen. It is used to select a displayed menu item or draw pictures on the monitor screen. It consists of a photocell and an optical system placed in a small tube.</p>
<p>When the tip of a light pen is moved over the monitor screen and the pen button is pressed, its photocell sensing element detects the screen location and sends the corresponding signal to the CPU.</p>
<h2>Track Ball</h2>
<p>Track ball is an input device that is mostly used in notebook or laptop computer, instead of a mouse. This is a ball which is half inserted and by moving fingers on the ball, the pointer can be moved.</p>
<p>Since the whole device is not moved, a track ball requires less space than a mouse. A track ball comes in various shapes like a ball, a button, or a square.</p>
<h2>Scanner</h2>
<p>Scanner is an input device, which works more like a photocopy machine. It is used when some information is available on paper and it is to be transferred to the hard disk of the computer for further manipulation.</p>
<p>Scanner captures images from the source which are then converted into a digital form that can be stored on the disk. These images can be edited before they are printed.</p>
<h2>Digitizer</h2>
<p>Digitizer is an input device which converts analog information into digital form. Digitizer can convert a signal from the television or camera into a series of numbers that could be stored in a computer. They can be used by the computer to create a picture of whatever the camera had been pointed at.</p>
<p>Digitizer is also known as Tablet or Graphics Tablet as it converts graphics and pictorial data into binary inputs. A graphic tablet as digitizer is used for fine works of drawing and image manipulation applications.</p>
<h2>Microphone</h2>
<p>Microphone is an input device to input sound that is then stored in a digital form.</p>
<p>The microphone is used for various applications such as adding sound to a multimedia presentation or for mixing music.</p>
<h2>Magnetic Ink Card Reader (MICR)</h2>
<p>MICR input device is generally used in banks as there are large number of cheques to be processed every day. The bank's code number and cheque number are printed on the cheques with a special type of ink that contains particles of magnetic material that are machine readable.</p>
<p>This reading process is called Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR). The main advantages of MICR is that it is fast and less error prone.</p>
<h2>Optical Character Reader (OCR)</h2>
<p>OCR is an input device used to read a printed text.</p>
<p>OCR scans the text optically, character by character, converts them into a machine readable code, and stores the text on the system memory.</p>
<h2>Bar Code Readers</h2>

<h1>Computer - Output Devices</h1>
<p>Following are some of the important output devices used in a computer.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Monitors</li>
<li>Graphic Plotter</li>
<li>Printer</li>
</ul>
<h2>Monitors</h2>
<p>Monitors, commonly called as <b>Visual Display Unit</b> (VDU), are the main output device of a computer. It forms images from tiny dots, called pixels that are arranged in a rectangular form. The sharpness of the image depends upon the number of pixels.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of viewing screen used for monitors.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT)</li>
<li>Flat-Panel Display</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) Monitor</h3>
<p>The CRT display is made up of small picture elements called pixels. The smaller the pixels, the better the image clarity or resolution. It takes more than one illuminated pixel to form a whole character, such as the letter ‘e’ in the word help.</p>
<p>A finite number of characters can be displayed on a screen at once. The screen can be divided into a series of character boxes - fixed location on the screen where a standard character can be placed. Most screens are capable of displaying 80 characters of data horizontally and 25 lines vertically.</p>
<p>There are some disadvantages of CRT &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Large in Size</li>
<li>High power consumption</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flat-Panel Display Monitor</h3>

<h1>Computer - Memory</h1>

<p>A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instructions. Computer memory is the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. The memory is divided into large number of small parts called cells. Each location or cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one. For example, if the computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024 = 65536 memory locations. The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535.</p>
<p>Memory is primarily of three types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cache Memory</li>
<li>Primary Memory/Main Memory</li>
<li>Secondary Memory</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cache Memory</h2>
<p>Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU. It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU. The parts of data and programs are transferred from the disk to cache memory by the operating system, from where the CPU can access them.</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p>The advantages of cache memory are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cache memory is faster than main memory.</li>
<li>It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.</li>
<li>It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time.</li>
<li>It stores data for temporary use.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<p>The disadvantages of cache memory are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cache memory has limited capacity.</li>
<li>It is very expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Primary Memory (Main Memory)</h2>
<p>Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working. It has a limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off. It is generally made up of semiconductor device. These memories are not as fast as registers. The data and instruction required to be processed resides in the main memory. It is divided into two subcategories RAM and ROM.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Main Memory</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>These are semiconductor memories.</li>
<li>It is known as the main memory.</li>
<li>Usually volatile memory.</li>
<li>Data is lost in case power is switched off.</li>
<li>It is the working memory of the computer.</li>
<li>Faster than secondary memories.</li>
<li>A computer cannot run without the primary memory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Secondary Memory</h2>
<p>This type of memory is also known as external memory or non-volatile. It is slower than the main memory. These are used for storing data/information permanently. CPU directly does not access these memories, instead they are accessed via input-output routines. The contents of secondary memories are first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it. For example, disk, CD-ROM, DVD, etc.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Secondary Memory</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>These are magnetic and optical memories.</li>
<li>It is known as the backup memory.</li>
<li>It is a non-volatile memory.</li>
<li>Data is permanently stored even if power is switched off.</li>
<li>It is used for storage of data in a computer.</li>
<li>Computer may run without the secondary memory.</li>
<li>Slower than primary memories.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="c8" class="tabcontent">
<h1>Random Access Memory</h1>

<p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result. It is a read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased.</p>
<p>Access time in RAM is independent of the address, that is, each storage location inside the memory is as easy to reach as other locations and takes the same amount of time. Data in the RAM can be accessed randomly but it is very expensive.</p>
<p>RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure. Hence, a backup Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) is often used with computers. RAM is small, both in terms of its physical size and in the amount of data it can hold.</p>
<p>RAM is of two types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Static RAM (SRAM)</li>
<li>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Static RAM (SRAM)</h2>
<p>The word <b>static</b> indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power is being supplied. However, data is lost when the power gets down due to volatile nature. SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors. Transistors do not require power to prevent leakage, so SRAM need not be refreshed on a regular basis.</p>
<p>There is extra space in the matrix, hence SRAM uses more chips than DRAM for the same amount of storage space, making the manufacturing costs higher. SRAM is thus used as cache memory and has very fast access.</p>
<h3>Characteristic of Static RAM</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Long life</li>
<li>No need to refresh</li>
<li>Faster</li>
<li>Used as cache memory</li>
<li>Large size</li>
<li>Expensive</li>
<li>High power consumption</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</h2>
<p>DRAM, unlike SRAM, must be continually <b>refreshed</b> in order to maintain the data. This is done by placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. DRAM is used for most system memory as it is cheap and small. All DRAMs are made up of memory cells, which are composed of one capacitor and one transistor.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Dynamic RAM</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Short data lifetime</li>
<li>Needs to be refreshed continuously</li>
<li>Slower as compared to SRAM</li>
<li>Used as RAM</li>
<li>Smaller in size</li>
<li>Less expensive</li>
<li>Less power consumption</li>
</ul>

<h1>Computer - Read Only Memory</h1>

<p>ROM stands for <b>Read Only Memory</b>. The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture. A ROM stores such instructions that are required to start a computer. This operation is referred to as <b>bootstrap</b>. ROM chips are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and microwave oven.</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the various types of ROMs and their characteristics.</p>
<h2>MROM (Masked ROM)</h2>
<p>The very first ROMs were hard-wired devices that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions. These kind of ROMs are known as masked ROMs, which are inexpensive.</p>
<h2>PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2>
<p>PROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the desired contents using a PROM program. Inside the PROM chip, there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.</p>
<h2>EPROM (Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2>
<p>EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of up to 40 minutes. Usually, an EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming, an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region. The charge is retained for more than 10 years because the charge has no leakage path. For erasing this charge, ultra-violet light is passed through a quartz crystal window (lid). This exposure to ultra-violet light dissipates the charge. During normal use, the quartz lid is sealed with a sticker.</p>
<h2>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2>
<p>EEPROM is programmed and erased electrically. It can be erased and reprogrammed about ten thousand times. Both erasing and programming take about 4 to 10 ms (millisecond). In EEPROM, any location can be selectively erased and programmed. EEPROMs can be erased one byte at a time, rather than erasing the entire chip. Hence, the process of reprogramming is flexible but slow.</p>
<h2>Advantages of ROM</h2>
<p>The advantages of ROM are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Non-volatile in nature</li>
<li>Cannot be accidentally changed</li>
<li>Cheaper than RAMs</li>
<li>Easy to test</li>
<li>More reliable than RAMs</li>
<li>Static and do not require refreshing</li>
<li>Contents are always known and can be verified</li>
