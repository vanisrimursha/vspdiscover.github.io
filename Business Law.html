<h1>Business Law - Company Law</h1>
<h2>What is a Company?</h2>
<p>Organizations require huge investments. As the investments are big, the risks involved are also very high. While undertaking a big business, the two important limitations of partnerships are limited resources and unlimited liabilities of partners. The company form of partnerships has become popular to overcome the problems of partnership business. Various multinational companies have their investors and costumers spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>In order to maximize and utilize the organizational and managerial abilities effectively, it is necessary for a limited liability company to be supported not only by its own organs but also by clear and precise regulations. It is necessary to have a brief overview of the business organization from the framework of company law.</p>
<p>Commercial sector recognizes three principal categories of business organizations &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Sole proprietorship (Generally used for informal purposes)</li>
<li>Partnership (General or limited)</li>
<li>Company</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three types of partnerships &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Persecution per data (governed by the civil code)</li>
<li>Persecution firms (governed by the civil code as well as the commercial code)</li>
<li>Persecution (governed by the civil code as well as the commercial code)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is difficult to determine the absolute equivalents between these partnerships and partnerships under common law tradition.</p>
<h2>Meaning and Nature of  Company</h2>
<p>According to the Companies Act, 1956, “A company is a person, artificial, invisible, intangible, and existing only in the contemplation of the law. Being a mere creature of the law, it possesses only those properties which the character of its creation confers upon it either expressly or as incidental to its very existence.”</p>
<p><b>It can clearly be defined that &minus;</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company is defined as a group of people that contributes money or the worth of money to a common stock to employ it in some trade or business. The people in this group share the profit or loss (as the case may be) arising as a result.</p></li>
<li><p>The common stock is usually denoted in terms of money and is the capital of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>The persons who contribute to the common stock are the members.</p></li>
<li><p>The proportion of the capital entitled to each member is called the member’s share.</p></li>
<li><p>Shares are always transferrable subject to the restrictions and liabilities offered by the rights to transfer shares.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main characteristics of a company are discussed below.</p>
<h3>Incorporated Association</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company can be created only under the registration of the Company Act.</p></li>
<li><p>It comes into existence from the date when the certificate of incorporation is issued.</p></li>
<li><p>At least seven persons are required to form a public company.</p></li>
<li><p>At least two persons are required to form a private company.</p></li>
<li><p>These persons will subscribe to the memorandum of associations and also comply with the other legal requirements of the Company Act in respect of registration to form and incorporate the company, with or without liability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Artificial Legal Person</h3>
<p>A company can be considered as an artificial person (a person who cannot act on his own will). It has to act through a board of shareholders elected or selected by the members of the company.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The board of directors works as the only brain of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>It has the rights to acquire and dispose the properties, to enter into contract with third parties in its own name, and can sue and can be sued in its own name.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it cannot be considered as a citizen as it cannot enjoy the rights of a citizen.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Separate Legal Entity</h3>
<p>A company is perceived to be a distinct legal entity and one that does not depend on its members. The money credited by the creditors of the company can be recovered only from the company and the properties owned by the company.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Individual members cannot be sued.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, the company in any way is not liable for the individual debts of the members.</p></li>
<li><p>The properties of the company can only be used for the development, betterment, maintenance, and welfare of the company and cannot be used for personal benefits of the shareholders.</p></li>
<li><p>A member cannot claim any ownership rights over the company either single-handedly or jointly.</p></li>
<li><p>The members of the company can enter into contracts with the company in the same manner as any other individual can.</p></li>
<li><p>The Income Tax Act also recognizes company as a separate legal entity.</p></li>
<li><p>The company has to pay income tax as it earns profits and when dividends are paid to the shareholders, the shareholders also have to pay income tax based on the dividends earned. This highlights the fact that the shareholders and the company are two separate individual entities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Perpetual Existence</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company is said to be a stable form of business organization.</p></li>
<li><p>A company’s life does not depend upon the death, insolvency or retirement of any or all of its shareholders or directors.</p></li>
<li><p>It is created by law and can only be dissolved by law.</p></li>
<li><p>Members can join or leave the company but the company can continue forever.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Common Seal</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>A company cannot sign documents by itself.</li>
<li>It acts through natural persons who are called its directors.</li>
<li>A common seal is used with the name of the company engraved on it as a substitute of its signature.</li>
<li>To be legally binding on the company, a document has to carry the company seal on it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limited Liability</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company may be limited by shares or by guarantee.</p></li>
<li><p>In a company limited by shares, the liability of members is limited to the unpaid value of the shares.</p></li>
<li><p>In a company limited by guarantee, the liability of members is limited to such an amount as the members may undertake to contribute to the asset of the company in the events of it being wound up.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Transferrable Shares</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The shares can be freely transferred in case of a public company.</p></li>
<li><p>The right to transfer shares is a statutory right and it cannot be taken away by any provision.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the manner in which such transfer of shares is to be made should be provided and it may also contain bona fide and reasonable restrictions on the rights of members for transfer of their shares.</p></li>
<li><p>However, in case of private companies, the article shall restrict the rights of the members to transfer their shares in companies with its statutory description.</p></li>
<li><p>If a company refuses to register the transfer of shares, a shareholder may apply to the Central Government in order to make the right to transfer shares legal.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Delegated Management</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Any company can be considered as an autonomous, self-governing and self-controlling organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to the presence of a large number of members, all members cannot take part in the management of different affairs of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Control and management is therefore delegated to the elected representatives called directors, who are elected by the shareholders.</p></li>
<li><p>The directors supervise the day-to-day work and progress of the company.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Classification of Companies</h2>
<p>All the companies must be registered under the Companies Act. A certificate of incorporation must be issued by the registrar of the company after registration. Different jurisdictions can form different companies. Some of the most common types of companies are as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Private Company</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company is said to be a private company if it does not allow its shareholders to transfer shares.</p></li>
<li><p>If any transfer of shares is allowed, the company limits the number of its members to 50 and does not entertain any invitations to the public for subscribing any shares of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>These types of companies offer limited liabilities to their shareholders but also place some restrictions on their ownership.</p></li>
<li><p>A private company can have a minimum of 2 members and a maximum of 50 members, excluding the employees and the shareholders.</p></li>
<li><p>A private company is desirable in those cases where it is intended to take the advantage of corporate life, has limited liability and the control of the business is in the hands of few persons.</p></li>
<li><p>In private sector, an individual can gain control of the entire business firm.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Public Company</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>At least seven members are needed to form a public company.</li>
<li>The maximum number of members remains unrestricted in the case of public companies.</li>
<li>A Prospectus is issued by the public companies to invite people to buy the shares of the company.</li>
<li>The liability of the members is limited by the value of the shares they purchase.</li>
<li>The shares of a public company are sold and bought freely without any obstruction in the stock market.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Companies Limited by Guarantee</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Every member of these companies promises to pay a fixed amount of money in the event of liquidation of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>This amount is denoted as guarantee.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no liability to pay anything more than the value of the share and the guarantee. Some of the substantial resultants of companies limited by guarantee are charities, community projects, clubs, societies, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of these companies are not into any profit-making.</p></li>
<li><p>These types of companies can be considered as private companies offering limited liabilities to their members.</p></li>
<li><p>A guarantee company substitutes share capitals with guarantors willing to pay a guarantee amount upon the liquidation of the company.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Companies Limited by Share</h3>
<p>In the case of companies limited by shares, the shareholders pay a nominal value of money contributing to the share capital. The payments can be done either at a time or by installments.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The members do not have to pay anything more than the fixed value of the share. Companies limited by shares are the most popular among the registered companies.</p></li>
<li><p>These types of companies are required to have the suffix ‘Limited’ at the end of their names so that the people know that the liability of its members is limited.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Unlimited Company</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Unlimited companies are the companies where the liabilities of the shareholders are unlimited as in the case of partnership firms.</p></li>
<li><p>Such companies are permitted under the Companies Act but are not known.</p></li>
<li><p>These types of companies are incorporated either with or without a share capital.</p></li>
<li><p>The shareholders are liable to donate whatever sums are required to pay the outstanding debts of the company, should it go into formal liquidation and if there is any need to meet the insufficiency of assets to pay the debts and liabilities and the fixed cost of liquidation.</p></li>
<li><p>The members or shareholders have no direct liability to the creditors or security holders of an unlimited company.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr /></div>
<div id="c2" class="tabcontent">
<h1>Business Law - The Corporate Veil</h1>
<p>It is seen that a company, as a person, has a legal identity of its own. An obvious consequence is that the company in question may become liable for the actions of the company.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Usually, the owners of the company are free from any liability.</p></li>
<li><p>It is assumed that the owners of the company are protected from liabilities by the company under a ‘veil of incorporation’.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there are certain circumstances when the court of law removes the veil so that the members of the corporation are not protected anymore by the veil.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there is no specific list of circumstances when the court of law is supposed to remove the veil.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the veil has been removed in the past under the following circumstances &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Where the formation of the company was intended for a fraudulent purpose.</li>
<li>Where the company was considered as an enemy at the time of war.</li>
<li>Where several groups of companies were regarded as one.</li>
<li>Where a company was treated as a partnership with an intent to wind up.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>Duties of Separate Legal Existence</h2>
<p>A company, after being incorporated, is considered as a separate person in the eyes of the law and the court of justice. Hence, the company is considered separate from its shareholders and the owners.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It has the right to sue and the company can be sued just as a natural person.</p></li>
<li><p>The liabilities of the owners and shareholders of the corporation are only limited to the value of shares invested in the specific company.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conversion from a Private Company to a Close Company</h2>
<p>Various difficulties may arise for a buyer when he tries to obtain a mortgage bond for paying the purchase price. According to section 38 of the Companies Act, no company is allowed to offer any financial help for the purpose of acquisition of shares of a company.</p>
<p>This justifies that if a company owns a particular property, the buyer cannot raise money based on this property to pay the purchase price.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>For avoiding this limitation, a company has to be converted into a close corporation.</p></li>
<li><p>No such limitation is invoked in the Close Companies Act.</p></li>
<li><p>For a company to become a close corporation, the number of shareholders of the company must be limited to 10.</p></li>
<li><p>The shareholders must also qualify the terms, conditions and set of qualifications as aforesaid by the Close Companies Act.</p></li>
<li><p>A registration number will be allotted to the company by the registrar upon such conversion.</p></li>
<li><p>According to the Companies Act, in the context of such a conversion, the existing shareholders become the only existing members of the company and no more shareholders are allowed after the conversion is performed.</p></li>
<li><p>The new found close corporation hence adopts the name of the private company from which it is derived.</p></li>
<li><p>A certificate on the basis of the foundation of the close corporation is issued.</p></li>
<li><p>A CCI (Close Corporation founding Statement) is also registered.</p></li>
<li><p>In case the members desire to change the name of the close corporation during the conversion, the registrar’s consent is required.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Close Corporation</h3>
<p>A close corporation can be considered analogous to a ‘younger brother’ of the company. It is way simpler and quicker to manage and maintain.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Annual income tax returns are required.</p></li>
<li><p>However, no audited financial statement is required by the law.</p></li>
<li><p>A close corporation can have the number of members limited to 10.</p></li>
<li><p>A close corporation also has a separate legal identity, i.e., it is also considered as a person in the views of the law irrespective of its members.</p></li>
<li><p>In many cases, a close corporation is intended for its owners to sell the properties owned by the close corporation.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually, any member of the close corporation may come into a contract on behalf of the close corporation.</p></li>
<li><p>However, restrictions may be imposed by an association agreement and the consent of a member holding a member’s interest of at least 75% or the consent of the members holding that percentage of member’s interest collectively.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Partnership</h3>
<p>A partnership is considered to be a formal relationship between a minimum of two and a maximum of twenty members based on an agreement intended to share profits through various business ventures, where each member contributes something (either money or skills) to the business.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>A partnership firm has no separate persona from the partners.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, it is treated as a separate entity for transaction and registrations.</li>
<li>An agreement bound by the partnership can be concluded by any of the partners.</li>
<li>The partnership will not be binding if a partner concludes a contract outside the scope of the partnership.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trusts</h3>
<p>A trust appears to be a complicated concept, not easily understood as a close corporation or a company. A trust does not have a separate legal identity. The law usually looks through the entity to what is behind it.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The rate of income tax imposed on a trust is similar to the rate of income tax imposed on a natural person and not a flat rate as imposed in the case of a closed corporation or a company.</p></li>
<li><p>A person does not own a trust.</p></li>
<li><p>A trust can neither have shareholders nor members.</p></li>
<li><p>A trust comes into existence when the founder of the trust hands over the ownership of an asset to a trustee who administers and manages the asset for the benefit of a beneficiary third person.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually, trusts are created for charitable purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>A trustee acts in his official capacity rather than his private capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>The ownership of a trust does not belong to any individual.</p></li>
<li><p>The ownership is divided between the trustees of the trust who work for the profit of a beneficiary.</p></li>
<li><p>The beneficiary does not have any control over the assets of the trust.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>A Sole Proprietorship</h3>
<p>A sole proprietorship can be considered as a single person business. It Small scale enterprises are generally owned and operated on the basis of sole proprietorship. Enterprises based on this do not require any registration. An informal trader or estate agent are probably the best examples of sole proprietors.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>A sole proprietor is considered to be an independent legal entity.</li>
<li>There is no legal protection against claims of a sole proprietor.</li>
<li>The personal properties or assets of a sole proprietor will be at stake in case he issued.</li>
<li>As the proprietor of the business, the owner carries the full risk of his assets and losses.</li>
<li>The owner may also be subjected to sequestration.</li>
<li>In the context of sequestration, if the proprietor is married in a community of property, the ownership of the estate owned by his spouse may also be held by a natural person, a trust or any other separate legal entity.</li>
<li>In case of any uncertainties whether to hold a property in a person’s personal name, legal consultants must be consulted before signing any legal agreement.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Business Law - Law of Arbitration</h1>

<p>With the increase in the international trade and the economic development of countries, there has also been an increase in the number of disputes related to commerce. Our country has also been the battleground of many disputes. Many Indian courts are already overburdened for justice in many serious cases, resulting in the lack of priority for commercial disputes. As a result, various alternative dispute resolution mechanisms like arbitration come into play.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of arbitration in India would be the panchayat system. People used to submit their disputes to the panchayats to seek justice. The Arbitration Act was passed in 1940 and hence was the law governing arbitration in India.</p>
<h2>The Arbitration Act, 1940</h2>
<p>Only domestic arbitration was dealt with by this act. According to this act, there were three stages of arbitration &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Before the reference of the dispute to the arbitral tribunal</li>
<li>During the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal</li>
<li>After the award was passed by the arbitral tribunal</li>
</ul>
<p>This act required all the intervention of the court in all the three stages of the arbitration process. It was needed to prove the existence of an agreement of the dispute. It was necessary for the award to become a rule of the court before the making of the award.</p>
<h2>The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</h2>
<p>The 1940 act was revisited in 1996. The 1940 act was revisited in order to provide an effective dispute resolution framework. The 1996 act has two important parts.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Part I is involved in any arbitration conducted in India and enforcement of awards respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Part II is involved in the enforcement of foreign awards.</p></li>
<li><p>Any arbitration or enforcement of award with respect to the arbitration (whether domestic or international) conducted in India is enacted by Part 1 of the 1996 Act.</p></li>
<li><p>The enforcement of any foreign award, to which the New York Convention or the Geneva Convention applies, is enacted by Part II of the 1996 Act.</p></li>
<li><p>The 1940 Act was designed for international arbitrations only, whereas the 1996 Act applies both to international as well as domestic arbitration.</p></li>
<li><p>The 1996 law goes beyond the 1940 Act with respect to the area of minimizing judicial intervention.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Business Law - Law of Carriage of Goods</h1>

<li><p>Except Jammu and Kashmir, the act applies to the whole of India.</p></li>

The weight and the number of packages should be stated in the railway receipt.</p></li>
<li><p>According to section 67, dangerous and offensive carriage should not be carried by any person unless the danger involved and offensiveness of the carriage is approved by the railway administration as a response to a notice containing the risks involved in the transportation of the carriage submitted by the person who is transporting the carriage or the dangerous and offensive nature of the carriage is distinctly marked on the package of the carriage.</p></li>
