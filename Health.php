<h1>Health and Care</h1>
<h3>If You Want to Live a Long and Healthy Life, Follow These Simple Tips</h3>
<p>When  it comes to health and longevity, there is no quick fix and no &ldquo;fountain of  youth&rdquo; that will help you become healthy overnight. Being fit and healthy in  order to reach a ripe old age takes effort and attention – this is something  that I repeatedly tell my readers.</p>
<p>But  here's the good news: there are a few simple lifestyle changes you can make to  improve not only the <em>quantity</em>, but  also the <em>quality</em> of your years. These  changes are pretty basic, but can have a profound effect on your overall health  once implemented.</p>
<h3>A Healthy Diet Is  Essential to Longevity</h3>

<p>One  of the most basic health principles (and, sadly, the one people most often  ignore) is eating a diet of whole, nutritious foods rather than unhealthy processed  foods. Keep in mind that processed and junk foods are loaded with grains,  sugar, and unhealthy calories that increase your insulin levels, which not only  accelerates the aging process but also increases your risk of obesity and  chronic disease.</p>
<p>I  also highly advise against consuming genetically engineered (GE) foods. Not  only are GE foods less nutritious than organically-grown foods, but they also  pose many health risks. In fact, most processed foods today contain GE ingredients – regardless of the fact that  these GE components have not undergone long-term safety studies.</p>
<p>The  best diet I would recommend for optimal health and longevity is one that's  focused on whole, unprocessed foods – preferably organic vegetables, grass-fed  meats, raw dairy, and nuts – acquired from healthy, sustainable, local sources.  I also recommend consuming a good portion of your food raw, as well as adding  naturally fermented foods to meals.</p>
<p>By implementing these basic diet changes, you can make a big  leap toward longevity and optimal health.</p>
<p>For  more useful tips in healthy eating, I advise you to follow the  Mercola Nutrition Plan, which will guide you in choosing the right foods that  will suit your unique biological makeup. The Mercola Nutrition Plan  addresses your unique biochemical needs based on your specific genetics,  allowing you to cure your health problems at the foundational level and giving  you a more permanent solution for regaining your health.</p>
<h3>Another Risk Factor  of Early Death: Living a Sedentary Lifestyle </h3>

<p>Equally  important to consuming a healthy diet is being physically active. According to studies,  people who are sedentary are found to have a shorter lifespan. In fact, one  study shows that reducing the average time you spend sitting down to less than  three hours a day may increase your life expectancy by two years, and reducing  the time you spend watching TV to less than two hours a day could increase it  by 1.4 years.</p>
<p>I  understand how difficult it is to avoid sitting down for prolonged periods, as  computer work is very predominant today. Even I am guilty of spending a  significant portion of my day sitting down. But to make up for it, I make sure that  I get enough exercise daily. I also take frequent breaks every hour to stand up  at my desk. I highly recommend Foundation Exercises, developed by chiropractor  Dr. Eric Goodman, as well as short-burst high-intensity exercises, like Peak  Fitness. You can read more about these techniques by subscribing to the .</p>
<p>Exercise  also has some anti-aging effects, as proven by many studies. One study  published in the <em>American Journal of  Physiology</em> says that exercise triggers mitochondrial biogenesis, a  decline of which is common in aging. This means that exercise can reverse  significant age-associated declines in mitochondrial mass and, in effect, stop  aging in its tracks.</p>
<h3>Basic Guidelines for Optimal  Health and Longevity: Try Them Today! </h3>

<p>Keep  in mind that modifying your diet and exercising are not the only important  factors of health and longevity. There are many other things that you need to implement  to ensure that you will be optimally healthy.</p>
<p>I  have created this infographic, &ldquo;11 Basic Guidelines for General Health and  Longevity,&rdquo; to summarize all the components that need to be addressed if you  want to live a long and healthy life. Here, you will learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Timeless  tips that will help improve your quality of health</li>
  <li>Healthy  anti-aging foods that you can add to your diet</li>
  <li>GE  crops, found mostly in processed foods, that contribute most to disease and  early aging</li>
  <li>Why  getting enough sun exposure is essential for optimal wellbeing</li>
</ul>
<p>These  guidelines form the basic tenets of optimal health. They are tried-and-tested  foundational strategies that will not change, no matter what improvements  modern science comes up with.    </p>
<p>I urge you to follow these tips to significantly decrease your likelihood of  disease and premature aging. Use these as the foundation of your overall  wellness plan, and you will surely succeed in improving your health.</p>

<h1>Tips</h1>
<p>There is no one food, drink, pill, machine, or program that is the key to achieving optimal health. A persons overall daily routine is what is most important. Consider the Health .</p>
<ol>
<li>?<strong> Embrace nutrition basics.</strong> Eating right doesnt have to be complicated. Forget the fad diets and adopt a healthy eating plan including a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and low-fat dairy.</li>
<li><strong>Move more.</strong> Aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity, such as walking, each week to assist in weight maintenance and overall health.</li>
<li><strong>Be smoke free.</strong> Make a plan for the challenges you will face and keep trying your best. Seek support and talk to your doctor about medications that can double your chances of quitting for good.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule sleep.</strong> Make sleep a priority to enjoy a more focused, energy-filled lifestyle. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Create a relaxing bed-time routine and change your electronic device settings to the  mode.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize preventive screenings.</strong> Many medical conditions can be recognized in the early stages by getting preventive screenings and immunizations. Ask your doctor about what screenings are recommended for you.</li>
<li><strong>Connect with others.</strong> Building a community of people who can help you through lifes ups and downs is a vital step towards happiness and good health. Invest in relationships that provide encouragement and accountability to both parties.</li>
<li><strong>Stress Less.</strong> Gratitude has been shown to lower stress, which prevents many other physical and mental consequences. Instead of focusing on what your body cant do or how you wish your body looked, try expressing gratitude for where you are now and the opportunity to make improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Work toward or maintain a healthy weight.</strong> If you are overweight, work toward losing 5-7% of your weight to significantly reduce your health risks. Studies show that individuals who track their intake using an app, such as myfitnesspal, lose more weight and keep it off compared to those who don’t track.</li>
<li><strong>Set SMART goals.</strong> General goals such as “exercise more” are not effective. A SMART goal is Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic, and Timely. “I will walk 20 minutes over my lunch break on Tuesdays and Thursdays” is a SMART goal.</li>
<li><strong>Stay positive.</strong> Health goals don’t always go as planned. When you face challenges, focus on all of the positive changes you have made, no matter how small they seem. Treat yourself with kindness, like you would a good friend.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Skin Care & Hair Care</h1>
<strong>
    <br>
    1. It is all in the genes
  </strong>
  <br>
  Remember that the most important factors that decide the quality of your skin and hair are your genes and family history, your nerves and emotions, and your immune system.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>2. Choose your face wash smartly</strong>
  <br>
  Use an appropriate face wash meant for your skin type and wash twice a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>3. Go for cleansers</strong>
  <br>
  Use cleansers at night to remove make-up and dirt before using a face wash.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>4. Hold onto sunscreens</strong>
  <br>
  Use sunscreen everyday even if you are indoors - the sun's  come through windows too and contribute to aging, pigmenting and tanning. Ideally, sunscreen should be applied every three hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>5. But not just any</strong>
  <br>
  Sunscreen should have an SPF of 30 or more. SPF is the degree of protection against UVB rays, hence sunscreen must have UVA protection as well. The usual UVA protection ingredients are Avobenzone, Titanium dioxide, Zinc oxide, Mexoryl and Tinosorb.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>6. Protect your skin from the sun</strong>
  <br>
  Make-up products like foundations, mineral powders and compacts do not have adequate sun protection.
  <br>
  <strong>
    <br>
    7. Tanning is not equal to pigmentation
  </strong>
  <br>
  Indian skin tends to tan and pigment easily and patchily. There is a very thin line between tanning and pigmentation. If your tan hasn't gone in 4-6 weeks, see a dermatologist.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>8. Stick to mild skin lightening creams</strong>
  <br>
  It is advisable to use mild skin lightening creams as prevention. Look for botanical ingredients like Arbutin, Bearberry, Licorice, Mulberry, Ginseng, Gingko, Emblica, Turmeric - curcuma, Grapeseed and vitamins like C and A, and Niacinamide.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>9. Delay your agin</strong>
  g
  <br>
  Aging can be intrinsic, i.e. genetic, and can be delayed by exercise and, to a lesser extent, through diet. Extrinsic factors include increased UV intensity, increased pollution as well as stress. All these factors tend to dry the skin and make it more prone to pigmentation and aging. Hence it is important to start caring for your skin in your teens.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>10. Go for antioxidants</strong>
  <br>
  Extrinsic factors produce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are naughty oxygen molecules that damage the cells and make them age faster. Anti-oxidants neutralise these ROS.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>11. Night care</strong>
  <br>
  At night, use a moisturiser with an age-protecting agent to complete your 'skin tips' list.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>12. Antioxidants</strong>
  <br>
  For younger skin, look for ingredients with antioxidants like vitamins C, E or a whole range of botanicals like green tea, grapeseed or pomegranate extract, curcumin, etc. You might also like to look out for the following: Genistein, ECGC, Resveratrol, Idebenone and Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>13. Skin care for older skin</strong>
  <br>
  For older skin, you cannot just follow any skin tips. Look for the following ingredients: peptides, vitamin A and derivatives like retinol and other retinoids, Alpha, beta and polyhydroxy acids.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>14. Exfoliation is important</strong>

  Exfoliation should be done with extreme caution and only with modern bead exfoliators. Avoid granular scrubs as these tend to damage the skin microscopically, which can lead to slow, insidious and patchy darkening.
 
  <strong>15. Consult a dermatologist</strong>

  It is advisable to visit a dermatologist at least once a year. There are a lot of nuances in skin colour, texture, smoothness, etc. that we can't see for ourselves. These can be detected by the dermatologist and mild creams/treatments can be recommended.
  <strong>16. Hair care</strong>
   Always use a conditioner after you shampoo your hair. It protects your hair and is a better option than oil. Conditioners neutralise electrical charge in the hair shaft and help in detangling. Conditioners also improve shine and to some extent repair minor frays in the hair shaft. Conditioning agents like hydrolized protein or silicons are added to increase manageability and shine in the hair.
