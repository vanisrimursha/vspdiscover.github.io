<h1>M-Commerce</h1>
<p>Buying and selling products and services through mobile devices are the new trend. A housewife can purchase her kitchen appliances from the comfort of her living room, a busy person can order lunch from office, one can use mobile platforms to sell goods and services &minus; all with a few clicks.</p>
<h2>What is M-Commerce?</h2>
<p>Mobile commerce or simply M-Commerce means engaging users in a buy or sell process via a mobile device. For instance, when someone buys an Android app or an iPhone app, that person is engaged in m-commerce. There are a number of content assets that can be bought and sold via a mobile device such as games, applications, ringtones, subscriptions etc.</p>
<h2>How does M-Commerce Work?</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some of the points that you need to remember as a business, while engaging in m-commerce &minus;</p>
<h3>Decide Where to Sell</h3>
<p>Before you sell your products or services via m-commerce, you need to decide what type of outlets or stores suit your business best. Let us suppose you have created ringtones &minus; you can sell them either at specific third-party outlets or to independent aggregators who charge you a commission for the service.</p>
<p>You can also sell your ringtones on mobile stores or app stores such as Android marketplace or App store (Apple). These stores are frequently visited by many buyers and hence ideal for making sales easily and efficiently. Finally, you can also sell via your own mobile store by creating a mobile website specifically for sales or as by setting-up an m-commerce page on your main website.</p>
<h3>Set up Mobile Billing</h3>
<p>Once you have decided where to sell, the next step is to set up your merchant account. For instance, you can use third-party services such as PayPal. This is ideal for small businesses or also large companies. A third-party application makes it really easy for you as well as your customers to make the payments, but then they do charge commission on the transaction.</p>
<p>You can also set-up your own billing and payment gateway, but make sure that you make it really easy for users. Mobile users do not use keyboards or a mouse so make sure that the design of your m-commerce site is intuitive, with easy navigation tools and the right display sizes. Basically, make your m-commerce site optimized for Smartphone users.</p>
<h2>Benefits of M-Commerce</h2>
<p>The major benefit of engaging in m-commerce is the sheer size of potential sales. The probability of your potential customers owning a Smartphone is very high, so you can safely assume that you will get much more positive response from mobile devices than your website. M-commerce is recommended for every business irrespective of its type, scale, and size.</p>

<h1>Mobile Marketing Strategies</h1>

<p>Unlike a traditional website, where you may have multiple products, features, and a ton of information, a mobile website focuses on facilitating users to complete a task easily, which can be placing an order to purchase, finding directions, checking out the weather and alike.</p>
<p>Before creating a mobile website, here are some points that one needs to keep in mind &minus;</p>
<h3>Developing Your Domain Strategy</h3>
<p>The domain name becomes important, if you are not developing a mobile responsive website using HTML5 and instead you want to create separate mobile websites. While creating separate websites, you can choose to use a relevant sub-domain name. For instance, if your primary website’s domain is <i>mywebsite.com</i> then you can name the mobile website as <i>mobile.mywebsite.com</i> or <i>m.mywebsite.com</i>.

<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Static Content</b> such as the information on you Contact us page, it never changes, but make sure that the text is readable on different devices.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Dynamic Content</b> which can be automatically pulled from content authoring tools such as contextual-help tips. It also need to be responsive.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Downloadable Content</b> such as PDF, audio, and video file that users can download on their mobile devices.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Streaming Content</b> such as audio and video file that users can listen and view on their mobile devices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, you need to ensure that all these four type of contents are viewable on all mobile devices.</p>

So, while designing your application, make sure that it runs on all these three top operating software. Once, you have done this, you need to pay attention to other design details such as the screen sizes of different mobile devices, the usability of the interface and so on.</p>

<p	>There are a number of ways to market your mobile application. The first one that comes to mind is of course the Apple App Store. There is also Android Marketplace. These stores are some of the best places to showcase your mobile apps. You can also market them on direct download sites such as download.com, getjar.com etc.</p>

<p>The most powerful aspect of a mobile application is the idea of personalization. From being a mere website, you become a personal tool that helps your customers to do a number of activities ranging from online purchasing to playing a game. The whole process of sales is turned on its head and your company develops an intimate relationship with the customers who will keep paying you with in-app purchases, and also popularizing the name of your brand via word-of-mouth.</p>

<h1>Return On Investment</h1>

<div style="text-align:center;">
ROI = 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Return &minus; Investment</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Investment</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>To understand the ROI from Mobile Marketing, let’s assume &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>C</b>ustomer <b>L</b>ifetime <b>V</b>alue (CLV)</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">CLV = Avg. Revenue per customer &times; Avg. No. of visits</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">Say, $100 per customer &times; 10 visits = $1,000</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate allowable <b>C</b>ost of <b>C</b>ustomer <b>A</b>cquisition (COCA) as &minus;</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">COCA = CLV &times; (% allocated to new customer)</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">Say, $1000 &times; 10% = $100</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, reallocate your mobile marketing budget by dividing them into ‘Branding’ and ‘Direct Response’. For example, allocate 20% of your budget to direct response &minus;</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">Say, direct response budget = $200,000</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">20% of $200,000 = $40,000</p>
<p>Hence, mobile marketing budget is <b>$40,000</b>.</p>
<p>Now, calculate the number of estimated customers from new mobile marketing campaign.</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">CLV= $1,000</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">Budget= $200,000</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">COCA= $100</p>
<p>Customers acquisition = budget &divide; COCA</p>
<p>Hence, $200,000 &divide; 100 = 2,000</p>
<p>Therefore, new customers = 2,000</p>
<p>Direct response (of new customers) = 2,000</p>
<p>Mobile marketing new customers = 400</p>
<p><b>Conclusion &minus; On 20% investment, you will gain 20% new customers.</b></p>
