  <h1>Overviewing of C</h1>
<p>C# is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Anders Hejlsberg to develop the Object Oriented Programming as Similar to .Net Programming.</p>
<p>C# was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1992.</p>

<p>In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C#, now known as the K&R standard.</p>

<p>The UNIX operating system, the C# compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C#. C# has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons -</p>

<p>Easy to learn</p>
<p>Structured language</p>
<p>It produces efficient programs</p>
<p>It can handle low-level activities</p>
<p>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms</p>
<h3>Facts about C#</h3>
<p>C# was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</p>

<p>C# is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.</p>

<p>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</p>

<p>The UNIX OS was totally written in C.</p>

<p>Today C# is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</p>

<p>Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C#.</p>

<p>Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C#.</p>

<h3>Why use C#?</h3>
<p>C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C# was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be -</p>

<p>Operating Systems</p>
<p>Language Compilers</p>
<p>Assemblers</p>
<p>Text Editors</p>
<p>Print Spoolers</p>
<p>Network Drivers</p>
<p>Modern Programs</p>
<p>Databases</p>
<p>Language Interpreters
Utilities</p>

<h3>A  C# program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".cs"; for example, hello.cs. You can use ".Net Text Editor", "Notepad++" or any other text editor to write your C Sharp program into a file.</h3>

<div id="c2" class="tabcontent">
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.</p>

<p>To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). Variable names are just the symbolic representation of a memory location. For example:</p>

<h3>int playerScore = 95;</h3>
<p>Here, playerScore is a variable of integer type. The variable is assigned value: 95.</p>

<p>The value of a variable can be changed, hence the name 'variable'.</p>

<p>In C# programming, you have to declare a variable before you can use it.</p>

<h3>Rules for naming a variable in C in Sparp</h3>
<p>A variable name can have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore only.</p>
<p>The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore. However, it is discouraged to start variable name with an underscore. It is because variable name that starts with an underscore can conflict with system name and may cause error.</p>
<p>There is no rule on how long a variable can be. However, only the first 31 characters of a variable are checked by the compiler. So, the first 31 letters of two variables in a program should be different.</p>
<p>C is a strongly typed language. What this means it that, the type of a variable cannot be changed.</p>



<h2>Constants/Literals</h2>
<p>A constant is a value or an identifier whose value cannot be altered in a program. For example: 1, 2.5, "C# programming is easy", etc.</p>

<p>As mentioned, an identifier also can be defined as a constant.</p>

<p>const double PI = 3.14</p>
<p>Here, PI is a constant. Basically what it means is that, PI and 3.14 is same for this program.</p>

<p>Below are the different types of constants you can use in C#.</p>

<h3>1. Integer constants</h3>
<p>An integer constant is a numeric constant (associated with number) without any fractional or exponential part. There are three types of integer constants in C programming:</p>

<p>decimal constant(base 10)
<p>octal constant(base 8)
<p>hexadecimal constant(base 16)

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Decimal constants: 0, -9, 22 etc</p>
<p>Octal constants: 021, 077, 033 etc</p>
<p>Hexadecimal constants: 0x7f, 0x2a, 0x521 etc</p>
<p>In C programming, octal constant starts with a 0 and hexadecimal constant starts with a 0x.</p>

<h3>2. Floating-point constants</h3>
<p>A floating point constant is a numeric constant that has either a fractional form or an exponent form. For example:</p>

<p>-2.0</p>
<p>0.0000234</p>
<p>-0.22E-5</p>
<p>Note: E-5 = 10-5</p>

<h3>3. Character constants</h3>
<p>A character constant is a constant which uses single quotation around characters. For example: 'a', 'l', 'm', 'F'</p>

<h3>4. Escape Sequences</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it is necessary to use characters which cannot be typed or has special meaning in C programming. For example: newline(enter), tab, question mark etc. In order to use these characters, escape sequence is used.</p>

<p>For example: \n is used for newline. The backslash ( \ ) causes "escape" from the normal way the characters are interpreted by the compiler.</p>

<h3>Escape Sequences</h3>
<h3>Escape Sequences	Character</h3>
<p>\b	Backspace</p>
<p>\f	Form feed</p>
<p>\n	Newline</p>
<p>\r	Return</p>
<p>\t	Horizontal tab</p>
<p>\v	Vertical tab
<p>\\	Backslash</p>
<p>\'	Single quotation mark</p>
<p>\"	Double quotation mark</p>
<p>\?	Question mark</p>
<p>\0	Null character</p>
<h3>5. String constants</h3>
<p>String constants are the constants which are enclosed in a pair of double-quote marks. For example:</p>

<p>"good"                  //string constant</p>
<p>""                     //null string constant</p>
<p>"      "               //string constant of six white space</p>
<p>"x"                    //string constant having single character</p>.
<p>"Earth is round\n"         //prints string with newline</p>
<h3>6. Enumeration constants</h3>
<p>Keyword enum is used to define enumeration types. For example:</p>

<h3>enum color {yellow, green, black, white};</h3>
<p>Here, color is a variable and yellow, green, black and white are the enumeration constants having value 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For more information, visit page: C Enumeration.</p>



<h3>Data types in C#</h2>
<h2>Fundamental Data Types</h3>
<p>Integer types</p>
<p>Floating type</p>
<p>Character type</p>
<h2>Derived Data Types</h3>
<p>Arrays</p>
<p>Pointers</p>
<p>Structures</p>
<p>Enumeration</p>

<h4>int - Integer data types</h4>
<p>Integers are whole numbers that can have both positive and negative values but no decimal values. Example: 0, -5, 10</p>

<p>In C# programming, keyword int is used for declaring integer variable. For example:</p>

<p>int id;</p>
<p>Here, id is a variable of type integer.</p>

<p>You can declare multiple variable at once in C# programming. For example:</p>

<h4>int id, age;
The size of int is either 2 bytes(In older PC's) or 4 bytes. If you consider an integer having size of 4 byte( equal to 32 bits), it can take 232 distinct states as: -231,-231+1, ...,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., 231-2, 231-1. If you try to store larger number than 231-1, i.e,+2147483647 and smaller number than -231, i.e, -2147483648, program will not run correctly.</h4>

<p>Similarly, int of 2 bytes, it can take 216 distinct states from -215 to 215-1.</p>

<h4>float - Floating types</h4>
<p>Floating type variables can hold real numbers such as: 2.34, -9.382, 5.0 etc. You can declare a floating point variable in C# by using either float or double keyword. For example:</p>

<p>float accountBalance;</p>
<p>double bookPrice;</p>

<p>Here, both accountBalance and bookPrice are floating type variables.</p>

<p>In C#, floating values can be represented in exponential form as well. For example:</p>

<h4>float normalizationFactor = 22.442e2;
Difference between float and double
The size of float (single precision float data type) is 4 bytes. And the size of double (double precision float data type) is 8 bytes. Floating point variables has a precision of 6 digits whereas the precision of double is 14 digits.</h4>

<h4>char - Character types</h4>
<p>Keyword char is used for declaring character type variables. For example:</p>

<p>char test = 'h';</p>
<p>Here, test is a character variable. The value of test is 'h'.</p>

<p>The size of character variable is 1 byte.</p>

<h3>C Qualifiers</h3>
<p>Qualifiers alters the meaning of base data types to yield a new data type.</p>

<h4>Size qualifiers</h4>
<p>Size qualifiers alters the size of a basic type. There are two size qualifiers, long and short. For example:</p>

<p>long double i;</p>
<p>The size of double is 8 bytes. However, when long keyword is used, that variable becomes 10 bytes.</p>

<p>Learn more about long keyword in C# programming.</p>

<p>There is another keyword short which can be used if you previously know the value of a variable will always be a small number.</p>

<h4>Sign qualifiers</h4>
<p>Integers and floating point variables can hold both negative and positive values. However, if a variable needs to hold positive value only, unsigned data types are used. For example:</p>

<p>// unsigned variables cannot hold negative value 
unsigned int positiveInteger;
There is another qualifier signed which can hold both negative and positive only. However, it is not necessary to define variable signed since a variable is signed by default.</p>

<p>An integer variable of 4 bytes can hold data from -231 to 231-1. However, if the variable is defined as unsigned, it can hold data from 0 to 232-1.</p>

<p>It is important to note that, sign qualifiers can be applied to int and char types only.</p>

<h4>Constant qualifiers</h4>
<p>An identifier can be declared as a constant. To do so const keyword is used.</p>

<p>const int cost = 20;</p>
<p>The value of cost cannot be changed in the program.</p>

<h4>Volatile qualifiers</h4>
<p>A variable should be declared volatile whenever its value can be changed by some external sources outside the program. Keyword volatile is used for creating volatile variables.</p>

  <h2>C Programming Operators and Expressions</h2>
<p>
In this Section, you will learn about Operators in C# Programming (all valid operators available in C), expressions (combination of operators, variables and constants) and precedence of operators (which operator has higher priority and which operator has lower priority).</p>

<h3>
C Operators</h3>

 <p>
Operators are the symbols which tell the computer to execute certain mathematical or logical operations.  A mathematical or logical expression is generally formed with the help of an operator. C# programming offers a number of operators which are classified into 8 categories viz.</p>

<p>Arithmetic operators</p>
<p>Relational operators</p>
<p>Logical operators</p>
<p>Assignment operators</p>
<p>Increment and Decrement operators</p>
<p>Conditional operators</p>
<p>Bitwise operators</p>
<p>Special operators</p>
<h4>1. Arithmetic Operators</h4>
<p>C programming language provides all basic arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / and %.</p>


<p>Note: ‘/’ is integer division which only gives integer part as result after division. ‘%’ is modulo division which gives the remainder of integer division as result.</p>

<p>Some examples of arithmetic operators are:</p>

<p>a + b</p>
<p>a – b</p>
<p>a * b</p>
<p>a  / b</p>
<p>a % b</p>
<p>In these examples, a and b are variables and are called operands.</p>

<p>Note: ‘%’ cannot be used on floating data type.</p>



<h4>2. Relational Operators</h4>
<p>Relational operators are used when we have to make comparisons. C# programming offers 6 relational operators.</p>



<p>Relational expression is an expression which contains the relational operator. Relational operators are most commonly used in decision statements like if, while, etc. Some simple relational expressions are:</p>

<p>1 < 5</p>
<p>9 != 8</p>
<p>2 > 1+3</p>
<p>Note: Arithmetic operators have higher priority than relational operators meaning that if arithmetic expressions are present on two sides of a relational operator then arithmetic expressions will be calculated first and then the result will be compared.</p>



<h4>3. Logical Operators</h4>
<p>Logical operators are used when more than one conditions are to be tested and based on that result, decisions have to be made. C programming offers three logical operators. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<p>a < 18 || a> 60 </p>
<p>An expression which combines two or more relational expressions is known as logical expression. </p>

 <p>   Note:  Relative precedence of relational and logical operators are as follows </p>

<p>Highest precedence   ! </p>
 

<p>> >= < <= </p>
 	<p>== != </p>
 	<p>&& </p>
<p>Lowest precedence	||  </p>
 


<h4>4. Assignment Operators</h4>

<p>Assignment operators are used to assign result of an expression to a variable. ‘=’ is the assignment operator in C#. Furthermore, C# also allows the use of shorthand assignment operators. Shorthand operators take the form: </p>

<p>var op = exp; </p>
<p>where var is a variable, op is arithmetic operator, exp is an expression. In this case, ‘op=’ is known as shorthand assignment operator. </p>

<p>The above assignment </p>

<p>var op = exp; </p>
<p>this is the same as the assignment </p>

<p>var = var op exp; </p>
<p>Consider an example: </p>

<p>x += y;</p>
<p>Here, the above statement means the same as</p>

<p>x = x + y;</p>
<p>Note: Shorthand assignment can be used with all arithmetic operators.</p>

<h4>5. Increment and Decrement Operators</h4>
<p>C programming allows the use of ++ and – operators which are increment and decrement operators respectively. Both the increment and decrement operators are unary operators. The increment operator ++ adds 1 to the operand and the decrement operator – subtracts 1 from the operand. The general syntax of these operators are:</p>

<p>Increment Operator: m++ or ++m;</p>

<p>Decrement Operator: m--or --m;</p>

<p>In the example above, m++ simply means m=m+1; and m-- simply means m=m-1;</p>

<p>Increment and decrement operators are mostly used in for and while loops.</p>

<p>++m and m++ performs the same operation when they form statements independently but they function differently when they are used in right hand side of an expression.</p>

<p>++m is known as prefix operator and m++ is known as postfix operator. A prefix operator firstly adds 1 to the operand and then the result is assigned to the variable on the left whereas a postfix operator firstly assigns value to the variable on the left and then increases the operand by 1. Same is in the case of decrement operator.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>X=10;</p>
<p>Y=++X;</p>


 

<p>In this case, the value of X and Y will be 6.</p>

<p>And,</p>

<p>X=10;</p>
<p>Y=X++;</p>
<p>In this case, the value of Y will be 10 and the value of X will be 11.</p>

<h4>6. Conditional Operator</h4>
<p>The operator pair “?” and “:” is known as conditional operator. These pair of operators are ternary operators. The general syntax of conditional operator is:</p>

<p>expression1 ? expression2 : expression3 ;</p>
<p>This syntax can be understood as a substitute of if else statement.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>a = 3 ;</p>
<p>b = 5 ;</p>
<p>Consider an if else statement as:</p>

<p>if  (a > b)</p>
<p>x = a ;</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>x = b ;</p>
<p>Now, this if else statement can be written by using conditional operator as:</p>

<p>x = (a > b) ? a : b ;
<h4>7. Bitwise Operator</h4>
<p>In C programming, bitwise operators are used for testing the bits or shifting them left or right. The bitwise operators available in C are:</p>



<h4>8. Special Operators</h4>
<p>C# programming supports special operators like comma operator, sizeof operator, pointer operators (& and *) and member selection operators (. and ->). The comma operator and sizeof operator are discussed in this section whereas the pointer and member selection operators are discussed in later sections.</p>

<h5>1. Comma Operator</h5>
<p>The comma operator can be used to link the related expressions together. A comma linked expression is evaluated from left to right and the value of the right most expression is the value of the combined expression.

<p>For example:</p>

          <p>      x = (a = 2, b = 4, a+b)</p>
<p>In this example, the expression is evaluated from left to right. So at first, variable a is assigned value 2, then variable b is assigned value 4 and then value 6 is assigned to the variable x. Comma operators are commonly used in for loops, while loops, while exchanging values, etc.</p>

<h5>2 .Sizeof() operator</h5>
<p>The sizeof operator is usually used with an operand which may be variable, constant or a data type qualifier. This operator returns the number of bytes the operand occupies. Sizeof operator is a compile time operator. Some examples of use of sizeof operator are:</p>

<p>x = sizeof (a);</p>
<p>y = sizeof(float);</p>
<p>The sizeof operator is usually used to determine the length of arrays and structures when their sizes are not known. It is also used in dynamic memory allocation.</p>

<h4>9.C# Expressions</h4>
<p>Arithmetic expression in C Sharp is a combination of variables, constants and operators written in a proper syntax. C# can easily handle any complex mathematical expressions but these mathematical expressions have to be written in a proper syntax. Some examples of mathematical expressions written in proper syntax of C are:
</p>
<p>Note: C# does not have any operator for exponentiation. </p>

<h4>10.C# Operator Precedence</h4>
<p>At first, the expressions within parenthesis are evaluated. If no parenthesis is present, then the arithmetic expression is evaluated from left to right. There are two priority levels of operators in C.</p>

<p>High priority: * /  %</p>
<p>Low priority: + -</p>

<p>The evaluation procedure of an arithmetic expression includes two left to right passes through the entire expression. In the first pass, the high priority operators are applied as they are encountered and in the second pass, low priority operations are applied as they are encountered.</p>

<p>Suppose, we have an arithmetic expression as:</p>

<p>x = 9 – 12 / 3 + 3 *2 - 1</p>
 <p>This expression is evaluated in two left to right passes as:</p>

<p>First Pass</p>

<p>Step 1: x = 9-4 + 3 * 2 – 1</p>
<p>Step 2: x = 9 – 4 + 6 – 1</p>

<p>Second Pass</p>

<p>Step 1: x = 5 + 6 – 1</p>
<p>Step 2: x = 11 – 1</p>
<p>Step 3: x = 10</p>
<p>But when parenthesis is used in the same expression, the order of evaluation gets changed.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>x = 9 – 12 / (3 + 3) * (2 – 1)</p>
<p>When parentheses are present then the expression inside the parenthesis are evaluated first from left to right. The expression is now evaluated in three passes as:</p>

<p>First Pass</p>

<p>Step 1: x = 9 – 12 / 6 * (2 – 1)</p>
<p>Step 2: x= 9 – 12 / 6 * 1</p>
<p>Second Pass</p>

<p>Step 1: x= 9 – 2 * 1</p>
<p>Step 2: x = 9 – 2</p>
<p>Third Pass</p>

<p>Step 3: x= 7</p>
<p>There may even arise a case where nested parentheses are present (i.e. parenthesis inside parenthesis). In such case, the expression inside the innermost set of parentheses is evaluated first and then the outer parentheses are evaluated.</p>

<p>For example, we have an expression as:</p>

<p>x = 9 – ((12 / 3) + 3 * 2) – 1</p>
<p>The expression is now evaluated as:</p>

<p>First Pass:</p>

<p>Step 1: x = 9 – (4 + 3 * 2) – 1</p>
<p>Step 2: x= 9 – (4 + 6) – 1</p>
<p>Step 3: x= 9 – 10 -1</p>
<p>Second Pass</p>

<p>Step 1: x= - 1 – 1</p>
<p>Step 2: x = -2</p>
<p>Note: The number of evaluation steps is equal to the number of operators in the arithmetic expression.</p>

 <h2>Input and Output Operation in C#</h2>

<p>Input Output operations are useful for program that interact with user, take input from the user and print messages. The standard library for input output operations used in C is stdlib. When working with input and output in C there are two important streams: standard input and standard output. Standard input or stdin is a data stream for taking input from devices such as the keyboard. Standard output or stdout is a data stream for sending output to a device such as a monitor console.</p>

<p>To use input and output functionality in your program, you need to include stdio header:</p>
<b>
 <p>#include <stdio.h></p></b>
<h3><p>Single Character Input and Output</p></h3>
<p>getc is used to accept a character from standard input and is declared as follows:</p>

<p>int getc(FILE *stream);</p>
<p>You would pass stdin for the stream to get input from the command line. getchar also has the same definition as getc.  It is equivalent to getc with stdin as its argument.</p>

<p>getc(stdin);</p>
<p>fgetc function is recommended for accepting a single character from standard input and is declared as follows:</p>

<p>int fgetc(FILE *stream);</p>
<p>If the call to fgetc is successful it returns char, otherwise it will return EOF (End of File).</p>

<p>putc is used for sending a single character to standard output and is defined as follows:</p>

<p>int putc(int c, FILE *stream);</p>
<p>fputc function is recommended instead of putc. fputc syntax is shown here below:</p>

<p>int fputc(int c, FILE *stream);</p>
<p>Below example demonstrates fgetc and fputc functions.</p>

<p>When fputc is successful, it will return the value, if it fails it will return EOF.</p>

<p>getachar.cs:</p>
<b>
<p> #include <stdio.h></p>
<p>void main() {</p>
<p>char ip; </p>
<p>//prompt for character and get input. </p>
<p>printf("Type a character and press enter.n");</p>
<p>ip = fgetc(stdin); </p>
<p>//write input value back out to standard out. </p>
<p>fputc(ip, stdout);</p>
<p>printf("n");</p>
<p>}</p></b>
<p>Here is the output I got when typing “a” for my character:</p>


<h3>String Input and Output</h3>
<p>You need not consider constructing for loops to get and print more than one character at a time. You can make use of similar functions for getting whole strings from standard input and printing them to standard output. They are fgets and fputs respectively.</p>

<h3>Prototypes:</h3>
<p>int fgets(char *restrict s, int n, FILE *restrict stream); </p>
 
<p>int fputs(char *restrict s, FILE *restrict stream);</p>
<p>The first argument you pass to fgets is a character array for putting the string value taken from the file stream. The n value is used as a limiter for the size (in bytes) of input accepted into the argument s. fgets will read from the file stream until it detects an EOF, a press of “Enter”, or n – 1 bytes have been read. It returns the value of s or a NULL pointer.</p>

<p>fputs is almost the same, besides that it does not require you to pass a number of bytes that will be accepted. It takes the character array you want to print out, and the stream you want to print it to.</p>

<p>Let us modify our example to read and print a string instead of just a character.</p>

<p>getastring.cs:</p>
<b>
<p> #include <stdio.h> </p>
<p>void main() {</p>
<p>int n = 40;</p>
<p>char ip[n]; </p>
<p>//prompt for a sentence and get input. </p>
<p>printf("Type a sentence and press enter.n");</p>
<p>fgets(ip, n, stdin); </p>
<p>//write input value back out to standard out. </p>
<p>fputs(ip, stdout);</p>
<p>}</p></b>
<p>In the above program fgetc and fputc function calls are replaced with fgets and fputs. We also added an integer value for bytes to be read. Now the program will accept a sentence instead of just a single character.</p>



<h3>Formatted Input with Scanf</h3>
<p>The prototype of the scanf function is shown below:</p>

<p>int scanf(const char *restrict format, ...);</p>
<p>scanf takes a variable number of arguments from standard input. You can get values for more than one variables with a single call to this function. All you have to do is specify the type of value you want with the conversion specifier operator (%) and the specifier and/or size.</p>

<p>Conversion specifiers may be of the following forms: %s, %ns, where s stands for specifier and n is the size.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<p>%3d would accept the first 3 unsigned decimal numbers it encountered while reading the stream. The whole call to scanf could look something like this:</p>

<p>scanf(%3d, anum);</p>
<p>If you type 1823 in a prompt where scanf was accepting %3d, it would assign only the 182 part to anum, the 3 would simply be discarded.</p>

<p>Let us do a quick example.</p>

<p>scanf.cs:</p>
<b>
<p> #include <stdio.h> </p>
 <p>void main() {</p> 
<p>int anum; </p>
<p>//prompt for character and get input. </p>
<p>printf("Type a series of numbers and press enter.n");</p>
<p>scanf("%3d", &anum); </p>
<p>//write input value back out to standard out. </p>
<p>printf("%dn", anum);</p>
<p>}</p></b>
<p>Note that you must pass your variable/s by reference because it needs to be able to modify them.</p>

<p>Expected output for the above program is showing below:</p>


<p>Input Specifications for Real Number</p>
<p>Use the %f specifier to accept floating point values. Ironically enough, the %d specifier will not accept decimal places. In order to accept a real number you would need to make a scanf call as follows:</p>

<p>scanf("%f", &anum);</p>
<p>Assuming that anum has been declared as a float.</p>

<p>You could now take 2.98 from standard input and it would be stored as 2.98, rather than 2 if you had used the %d specifier.</p>

<h3>Input Specifications for a Character</h3>
<p>Accepting character input from standard input to the scanf function works just like it did with integers. You can take a single character, or a specified number of them.</p>

<p>Let us modify our example program scanf.c to accept characters instead of integers. If we change scanf call for accepting 3 integers to 3 characters all we have to do is change the specifier. Of course we also have to change anum to a character array, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>scanf(%3c, anum);</p>
<p>Printing One Line</p>
<p>You can print a single line to the standard output as shown below: </p>

<p>printf("Type a series of numbers and press enter.n");</p>
<p>Note the newline added at the end of the string. That is so the cursor will move down to the next line. Still technically one line though.</p>

<h3>Conversion Strings and Specifiers</h3>
<p>The usage of printf is almost identical to the usage of scanf we have just talked about. Take a look at the prototype:</p>

<p>int printf(const char *restrict format, ...);</p>
<p>Printf takes specifiers and a variable number of arguments. You can enter a whole list of arguments and specifiers, just make sure they line up so you do not put the wrong value in the wrong variable.
</p>
<p>You can also insert newline, as you may have seen throughout the tutorials thus far.</p>

<p>Let us make a call to printf that will print that same value:</p>

<p>scanf("%f", &anum);</p>
<p>printf("%f", anum);</p>
<p>The above program is similar to the call to scanf to read a real number, the difference being that we did not have to pass anum by reference to printf.</p>

<h3>Specifier Meaning</h3>
<p>There are more specifiers than we have shown up until now.</p>

<p>%d, %i: signed integer values</p>
<p>%o: unsigned octal</p>
<p>%s: character array</p>
<p>%c: unsigned character</p>
<p>%f, %F: float</p>
<p>%ld: long</p>
<p>%x: lowercase hexadecimal</p>
<p>%X: uppercase hexadecimal</p>
<p>%e: exponential form for a double</p>
<p>%p: pointer</p>
<p>%a: unsigned integer</p>

  <h2>Decision Making Statement</h2>

<p>Decision making statement is depending on the condition block need to be executed or not which is decided by condition.</p>

<p>If the condition is "true" statement block will be executed, if condition is "false" then statement block will not be executed.</p>

<p>In this section we are discuss about if-then (if), if-then-else (if else), and switch statement. In C# language there are three types of decision making statement.</p>

<p>if</p>

<p>if-else</p>
<p>switch</p>

<p>if-then Statement</p>

<p>if-then is most basic statement of Decision making statement. It tells to program to execute a certain part of code only if particular condition is true.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b></p>

<p>if(condition)</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>.......</p>

<p>.......
</p>
<p>}</p>

<h2>If Statement</h2>

<p>Constructing the body of "if" statement is always optional, Create the body when we are having multiple statements.</p>

<p>For a single statement, it is not required to specify the body.</p>

<p>If the body is not specified, then automatically condition part will be terminated with next semicolon ( ; ).</p>

<h2>else</h2>

<p>It is a keyword, by using this keyword we can create a alternative block for "if" part. Using else is always optional i.e, it is recommended to use when we are having alternate block of condition.</p>



<p>In any program among if and else only one block will be executed. When if condition is false then else part will be executed, if part is executed then automatically else part will be ignored.</p>

<h2>if-else statement</h2>

<p>In general it can be used to execute one block of statement among two blocks, in C# language if and else are the keyword in C#.</p>

<p><b>if else statement</p>

<p>Syntax</b></p>

<p><b><i>if(condition)</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>........</p>

<p>statements</p>

<p>........</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>else</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>........</p>

<p>statements</p>

<p>........</p>

<p>}</i></b></p>

<p>In the above syntax whenever condition is true all the if block statement are executed remaining statement of the program by neglecting else block statement. If the condition is false else block statement remaining statement of the program are executed by neglecting if block statements.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p><h4>#include<stdio.h></p>

<p>#include<conio.h></p>



<p>void main()</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>int time=10;</p>


<p>clrscr();</p>

<p>if(time>12)</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>printf("Good morning");</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>printf("Good after noon");</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>getch();</p>

<p>}</h4></p>

<p><b>Output</b></p>

<h3>Good morning</h3>

<h2>Switch Statement</h2>

<p>A switch statement work with byte, short, char and int primitive data type, it also works with enumerated types and string.</p>



<p><b>switch case</b></p>

<p><h4>Syntax</p>

<p>switch(expression/variable)</p>

<p>{</p>


<p>case  value:</p>

<p>//statements</p>

<p>// any number of case statements</p>

<p>break;  //optional</p>

<p>default: //optional</p>

<p>//statements</p>

<p>}</h4>
</p>
<h3>Rules for apply switch</h3>

<p>With switch statement use only byte, short, int, char data type.</p>

<p>You can use any number of case statements within a switch.
</p>
<p>Value for a case must be same as the variable in switch .</p>

<h3><p>Limitations of switch</p></h3>

<p>Logical operators cannot be used with switch statement. For instance</p>


<p><i>Example</p>

<p>case k>=20:	//is not allowed</p>

<p>Switch case variables can have only int and char data type. So float data type is not allowed.</p>


<p>Syntax</p>

<p>switch(ch) </p>

<p>{ </p>

<p>case1:   </p>

<p>statement 1;</p> 

<p>break; </p>

<p>case2: 
</p>
<p>statement 2; </p>

<p>break; </p>
<p>} </i>
</p>
<p>In this ch can be integer or char and cannot be float or any other data type.</p>


<p><i>Example of Switch case
</p>

<p>#include<stdio.h></p>

<p>#include<conio.h></p>


<p>void main()</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>int ch;</p>


<p>clrscr();</p>

<p>printf("Enter any number (1 to 7)");</p>

<p>scanf("%d",&ch);</p>

<p>switch(ch)</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>case  1:</p>

<p>printf("Today is Monday");</p>

<p>break;</p>

<p>case  2:</p>

<p>printf("Today is Tuesday");</p>

<p>break;</p>

<p>case  3:</p>

<p>printf("Today is Wednesday");</p>

<p>break;</p>

<p>case  4:</p>

<p>printf("Today is Thursday");</p>

<p>break;</p>

<p>case  5:</p>


<p>printf("Today is Friday");</p>

<p>break;</p>

<p>case  6:</p>

<p>printf("Today is Saturday");</p>



<p>break;</p>

<p>case  7:</p>

<p>printf("Today is Sunday");</p>

<p>break;</p>


<p>default:</p>

<p>printf("Only enter value 1 to 7");</p>

<p>}</p>


<p>getch();</p>


<p>}</i></p>

<p><h4>Output</p>

<p>Enter any number (1 to 7): 5</p>

<p>Today is Friday</h4></p>

<p>Note: In switch statement default is optional but when we use this in switch default is executed at last whenever all cases are not satisfied the condition.</p>

<h2>Looping Statements In C#</h2>

<p>Loop control statements in C# are used to perform looping operations until the given condition is true. Control comes out of the loop statements once condition becomes false.</p>

<h3>TYPES OF LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS IN C:</h3>

<p>There are 3 types of loop control statements in C# language. They are,</p>
<b>
<p>for</p>
<p>while</p>

  <h2>Array</h2>

<p>An array is a sequential collection of variables of same data type which can be accessed using an integer as index, that generally starts from 0. It stores data elements in a continuous memory location. Each element can be individually referenced with its respective index.</p>

<h3>1-Dimensional array:</h3>
 <p>It is a linear array that stores elements in a sequential order. Let us try to demonstrate this with an example: Let us say we have to store integers 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7. We can store it in an array of integer data type. The way to do it is:</p>

<p> dataType nameOfTheArray [sizeOfTheArray];  </p>
<p>int Arr[6];</p>
<p>Here Arr is the name of array and 6 is the size. It is necessary to define the size array at compile time.</p>

<p>To store the above elements in the array:</p>

<p>dataType nameOfTheArray [ ] = {elements of array };</p>


  <p> int Arr [ ] = { 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7 };</p>
<p>Since, the indexing of an array starts from 0, if the 4th element needs to be accessed, Arr [ 3 ] will give you the value of the 4th element. Similarly, nth element can be accessed by Arr[n-1].</p>


<h3>Multidimensional array: </h3>

<p>It can be considered as an array of arrays. The most commonly used multidimensional array is 2-dimensional array. It stores the elements using 2 indices, which give the information, in which row and which column a particular element is stored. A 2D array is essentially a matrix.</p>

<h3>Declaration:</h3>

<p>char A[ 3 ] [ 2 ] ;</p>
<p>Here, A is a 2D array of character data type. The array contains 3 rows and 2 columns.</p>

<p>This array can be used to store 3 words of length 2, for example - PI, OM, GD. These words will be stored in the array as shown in the figure: </p>
<p>Here rows and columns start with 0 index. If you have to access ‘M’ character, you can access it by A[ 1 ] [ 1 ].</p>

<p>Let’s experiment with the code below:</p>

<p>#include<stdio.h></p>
<p>#include<iostream></p>

<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main( ) {</p>
    <p>int Arr[6]; // declaring Arr</p>
    <p>Arr[ ] = { 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7 }; // Initializing Arr by storing some elements in it.</p>
    <p>char A [ 3 ] [ 2 ]; // declaring a 2D array</p>
<p>    A [ 3 ] [ 2 ] = { { ‘P’, ‘I’} , {‘O’, ‘M’ } , {‘G’, ‘D’} } ;</p>

<p>    // Accessing and printing the 3rd element of the first array.</p>
    <p>printf(“The third element of Arr is\n ”,  Arr[ 2 ]);</p>

<p>   // Printing all the elements of Arr</p>
   <p>for (int i = 0; i < 6 ; i ++ )</p>
       <p>printf(“%d “, Arr[i]);</p>
   <p>printf(“\n”);</p>

<p>   // Printing all the element of A[ ][ ] </p>
  <p> printf(“All the elements of 2D array A[ ][ ] are : \n”);</p>

<p>   for( int i = 0 ; i < 3; i++ ) {</p>
      <p>for(int j= 0 ; j < 2 ; j++ ) {</p>
     <p>       printf(“%c “, A[i][j]);</p>
   <p>}</p>
   <p>printf(“\n”);</p>
  <p>}</p>
  <p>return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Output :</p>

<p>The third element of Arr is 5</p>
<p>2 3 5 4 6 7 </p>
<p>All the elements of 2D array A[ ][ ] are</p> : 
<p>P I </p>
<p>O M </p>
<p>G D</p>

<p>Time for a surprise quiz on array? Great. Here it is. Let’s say that you have an array: A[ 6 ] = {2, 5, 6, 4, 7, 9} and you have to find the sum of elements between index 2 to 4. How will you do that ?</p>

<p>You can simply run a loop from starting index to ending index and can store the sum in the particular variable. Let’s implement this in C#:</p>

<p>#include<iostream></p>
<p>#include<stdio.h></p>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main ( ) {</p>
    <p>int A[ 6 ] = {2, 5, 6, 4, 7, 9 } ;</p>

<p>    // Take a variable of integer type to store sum and initialize it to 0 .</p>
    <p>int SUM = 0;</p>

<p>    /* Run a loop from starting index to ending index. */</p>

<p>    for( int i = 2 ; i <= 4 ;i++ ) {</p>
       <p> SUM = SUM + A[ i ] ;</p>
   <p> }</p>
    <p>printf(“The required output is:  %d\n”, SUM);</p>
    <p>return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Output : </p>
<p>The required output is: 17</p>

<h2>String</h2>


<p>C-style strings are one dimensional array of characters. However they have a special property, they end with a null character (‘\0’) to signify the end of the string.</p>

<h3>Declaration:</h3>

<p>char str[ 6 ];</p>
<p><b>Initialization: A character array can be initialized like any other normal array</b></p>

<p>char str[ 6 ] = { ‘H’, ‘E’, ‘L’, ‘L’, ‘O’ };</p>
<p>or it can directly be initialized using a string literal</p>

<p>char str[ ] = “HELLO”;</p>
<p>enter image description here</p>

<p>str is a string which has an instance (string literal) “HELLO”. In spite of only 5 characters, the size of the string is 6, because the null character represents the end of the string. The null character is automatically added by the compiler as long as the size of the array is at least one larger than the size of the string. It is not mandatory that the array size (N) be exactly greater than the size of the string (n) by 1 i.e. N >= n + 1 
enter image description here</p>
<p>To take C#-style string as an input you can simple use scanf() with ‘%s’ format specifier or we can also use cin. It will take input until we press a space or enter. For example:</p>

<p>char a[10];</p>
<p>scanf(“%s”, a);</p>
<p>Similarly you can print the C-style string with the printf() with ’%s’ format specifier or cout.</p>

<p>printf(“%s\n”, a);</p>
<p>Now let us talk about C# string data type. It is different than your usual C-style string function in many ways. In C, strings are just character arrays which end with a null character. However in C++ strings, one need not bother about the dimensions of the array, or the null character. C# provides an internal class type which is used for working with strings. Strings can be declared and initialized as follows</p>

<h3>Declaration:</h3>

<p>string str;</p>

<p><b>Initialization:</b></p>

<p> string str = “HELLO”;</p>
<p>Please note that even though C# strings are a separate class type, their characters can still be referenced using a 0 based indexing, just like C# strings. For example in the above example str[ 2 ] is the character ‘L’ and one can iterate over the string just like a normal array.</p>

<p>Let us now consider some functions which we can perform on strings. In C# there are some predefined functions that can be used to do common operations on strings like copy, concatenation, comparison and finding the length. An important thing to note is that all the functions which are used in C#-style string function can also be applied on C string.</p>

<p>Copy: Copy one string to other. C#-style string function:</p>

<p> strcpy(s1, s2);</p>
      

<p><strong>
  s2 = s1;</p>
<p>Length: Finding the length of the string. C#-style string function: strlen(s1); C# string:</p>

<p>s1.size();</p>
<p>Concatenate: Adding one string at the end of the other. C#-style string function: strcat(s1, s2);</p>


<p>s1 += s2;</p>
<p>Compare: Comparing two string if they are equal or not. C#-style string function:</strong></p>

<p>strcmp(s1, s2);</p>
<h3>Example</h3></p>

<p>#include <stdio.h></p>
<p>#include <iostream></p>
<p>#include <cstring></p>

<p>using namespace std;</p>

<p>int main() {</p>
 <p>   char str[] = “HELLO”;                   // Declaration and Initialization</p>
    <p>int length1 = 0, length2;</p>

    <p>// Loop from beginning till we reach null character.</p>
   <p> for(int i = 0 ; str[i] != ‘\0’; ++i)   </p>             
  <p>      length1++;</p>

   <p> length2 = strlen(str);</p>
  <p>  printf(“The length of the string str is: %d\n”, length1);</p>
   <p> printf(“The length of the string str is: %d\n”, length2);</p>
    <p>return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<p>The length of the string str is: 5</p>
<p>The length of the string str is: 5</p>

  <h2>Built In& User Defined Function</h2>

<p>There are several different types of functions in C#. So far, we have used one type of function:built-in C functions, like printf( ) and scanf( ). These functions are part of the C programming language.</p>

<p>Another type is called a user-defined function. This is a function which the programmer creates and uses in a C# program. We will learn how to create these functions in this part of the tutorial.</p>

<p>We can also distinguish between functions which return values and those which don’t — like void main( ). Technically speaking, all functions return values, but in C# we can choose to eliminate this process by using void. So far, we have not used our main( ) function to return any values, so we voided it and let the body functions, like printf( ) return values.</p>


<p>A function which return values produces some result — like printing text on the screen, or scanning a variable, etc. Let’s examine the different types of functions, so we can understand them better.</p>

<h2>Built-in Functions</h2>
<p>C has many built-in functions that you can use in your programs. So far we have learned 15 built-in functions:</p>

<p>main( )</p>
<p>printf( )</p>
<p>scanf( )	gets( )</p>
<p>puts( )</p>
<p>strcpy( )	strlen( )</p>
<p>strcmp( )</p>
<p>stricmp( )	strcat( )</p>
<p>strstr( )</p>
<p>isalpha( )  isdigit( )</p>
<p>isupper( )</p>
<p>islower( )</p>
<p>If you can’t remember how to use each of these functions, go back and review the previous sections of this tutorial.</p>

<h2>User-Defined Functions</h2>

<p>If you have a special set of instructions that aren’t in a built-in function, you can create a user-defined function. Here are the steps:</p>

<p>give your function a name that isn’t already used in C# (by built-in functions, types of variables, keywords, etc.)
create a function header, which contains three things:</p>

<p><strong>a. the type of variable (int, char, double, etc.) that the function will produce (return)</p>

<p>b. the name of the function, which can be one or more words (but put underscores _ or CapitalLetters connecting these words, because no spaces are allowed)</p>

<p>c. the parameters of the function, which are the names and types of variables inside your function</strong></p>

<p>create a function body, which contains the operations to be completed when you call the function to run
Function Header</p>

<p>Here is an example of a function header:</p>

<p><b>int Square(int num)This function expects an integer variable, so we begin with int.</b></p>

<p>Then we type a space followed by the name of the function, Square.</p>

<p>Next, we put the parameters in parentheses: (int num).</p>

<p><b>Function Body</p>
<p>Now we can add variables and functions to create a function body:</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>return (num * num);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p></b></p>
<p>This function calculates the square of num, which is num * num. This function returns the value of num * num.</p>

<p><b>Location and Call</b></p>
<p>To use this function, we must write it before void main( ) or after void main( ). We don’t want to write it inside void main( ), since Square( ) is a function separate from main( ).</p>
<b>
<p>#include<stdio.h></p>
<p>int Square(int num)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>return (num * num);</p>
<p>}</b></p>

<p>Inside void main( ), we must call the function Square( ) to run. This means triggering the function to activate. This involves three things:</p>

<p>a variable equal to the value returned from the function</p>
<p>the name of the function</p>
<p>the variable passed to the function</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p><b>void main( )</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>int num;</p>
<p>int total;</p>
<p>total = Square(num);</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>*****The Square Function*****</p>
<p>#include<stdio.h></p>
<p>int Square(int num)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>return (num * num);</p>
<p>}void main( )</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>int num;</p>
<p>int total;</p>
<p>printf(“Type a number: “);</p>
<p>scanf(“%d”, &num);</p>
<p>total = Square(num);</p>
<p>printf(“Your number squared is %d.”, total);</p>
<p>}</b></p>

<p><b>You can create more than one function in a C# program. Each function will need its own return statement and its own variable to store the returned value. Here is an example:</b></p>

<h2>Structures</h2>

<p>In the C# language structures are used to group together different types of variables under the same name. For example you could create a structure “telephone”: which is made up of a string (that is used to hold the name of the person) and an integer (that is used to hold the telephone number).</p>
<p>Take a look at the example:</p>


	<p>struct telephone</p>
	<p>{</p>
	<p>	char *name;</p>
	<p>	int number;</p>
	<p>};</p>

<p><b>Note: the ; behind the last curly bracket.</b></p>

<p>With the declaration of the structure you have created a new type, called telephone. Before you can use the type telephone you have to create a variable of the type telephone. Take a look at the following example:</p>


	<p>#include<stdio.h></p>

	<p>struct telephone</p>
	<p>{</p>
		<p>char *name;</p>
		<p>int number;</p>
	<p>};</p>

	<p>int main()</p>
	<p>{</p>
		<p>struct telephone index;</p>

		<p>return 0;</p>
	<p>}</p>

<p><b>Note: index is now a variable of the type telephone.</b></p>
<p>To access the members of the structure telephone, you must use a dot between the structure name and the variable name(variables:name or number.) Take a look at the next example:</p>


	<p>#include<stdio.h></p>

	<p>struct telephone</p>
	<p>{</p>
		<p>char *name;</p>
		<p>int number;</p>
	<p>};</p>

	<p>int main()</p>
	<p>{</p>
	<p>	struct telephone index;</p>

		<p>index.name = "Jane Doe";</p>
		<p>index.number = 12345;</p>
		<p>printf("Name: %s\n", index.name);</p>
		<p>printf("Telephone number: %d\n", index.number);</p>
		<p>return 0;</p>
	<p>}</p>

<h2>Unions</h2>

<p>A union is like a structure in which all members are stored at the same address. Members of a union can only be accessed one at a time. The union data type was invented to prevent memory fragmentation. The union data type prevents fragmentation by creating a standard size for certain data. Just like with structures, the members of unions can be accessed with the . and -> operators. Take a look at the example:</p>

<b><p>Example</b><p>
	<p>#include<stdio.h></p>

	<p>typedef union myunion</p>
	<p>{</p>
		<p>double PI;</p>
		<p>int B;</p>
	<p>}MYUNION;
</p>
	<p>int main()</p>
	<p>{</p>
		<p>MYUNION numbers;</p>
		<p>numbers.PI = 3.14;</p>
		<p>numbers.B = 50;</p>

	<p>return 0;</p>
	<p>}</p>

</div>

<div id="c10" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Pointer</h2>

<p>A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is -type *var-name;</p>

<p>Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C# data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations -</p>

<p>int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */</p>
<p>double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */</p>
<p>float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */</p>
<p>char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */</p>
<p>The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.</p>

<p><b>How to Use Pointers?</b></p>

<p>There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations </p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>#include <stdio.h></p>

<p>int main () {</p>

 <p>  int  var = 20;   /* actual variable declaration */</p>
 <p>  int  *ip;        /* pointer variable declaration */</p>

 <p>  ip = &var;  /* store address of var in pointer variable*/</p>

 <p>  printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &var  );
</p>
 <p>  /* address stored in pointer variable */</p>
<p>   printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );</p>

  <p> /* access the value using the pointer *</p>
 <p>  printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );</p>

  <p> return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<p>Address of var variable: bffd8b3c</p>
<p>Address stored in ip variable: bffd8b3c</p>
<p>Value of *ip variable: 20</p>

<h3>NULL Pointers</h3>
<p>It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.</p>

<p>The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program </p>

<p> <b>Example</b></p>
<p>#include <stdio.h></p>

<p>int main () {</p>

  <p> int  *ptr = NULL;</p>

 <p>  printf("The value of ptr is : %x\n", ptr  );</p>
 
 <p>  return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>

<p>The value of ptr is 0</p>


<p>In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.</p>

<p>To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows -</p>

<p>if(ptr)     /* succeeds if p is not null */</p>
<p>if(!ptr)    /* succeeds if p is null */</p>
<p>Pointers in Detail</p>
<p>Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer </p>


<p>1	<b>Pointer arithmetic</b>--->There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -</p>

<p>2	<b>Array of pointers</b>-->You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.</p>

<p>3	<b>Pointer to pointer</b>-->C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.</p>

<p>4	<b>Passing pointers to functions in C</b>-->Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.</p>

<p>5	<b>Return pointer from functions in C</b>-->C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.</p>

  <h2>Files</h2>
<h3>Why files are needed?</h3>

<p>When a program is terminated, the entire data is lost. Storing in a file will preserve your data even if the program terminates.</p>
<p>If you have to enter a large number of data, it will take a lot of time to enter them all.</p>
<p>However, if you have a file containing all the data, you can easily access the contents of the file using few commands in C#.</p>
<p>You can easily move your data from one computer to another without any changes.</p>

<h3>Types of Files</h3>

<p>When dealing with files, there are two types of files you should know about:</p>

<p>1.Text files</p>
<p>2.Binary files</p>

<h3>1. Text files</h3>
<p>Text files are the normal .txt files that you can easily create using Notepad or any simple text editors.</p>

<p>When you open those files, you'll see all the contents within the file as plain text. You can easily edit or delete the contents.</p>

<p>They take minimum effort to maintain, are easily readable, and provide least security and takes bigger storage space.</p>

<h3>2. Binary files</h3>
<p>Binary files are mostly the .bin files in your computer.
</p>
<p>Instead of storing data in plain text, they store it in the binary form (0's and 1's).</p>

<p>They can hold higher amount of data, are not readable easily and provides a better security than text files.</p>

<h3>File Operations</h3>
<p>In C, you can perform four major operations on the file, either text or binary:</p>

<p>Creating a new file</p>
<p>Opening an existing file</p>
<p>Closing a file</p>
<p>Reading from and writing information to a file</p>
<p>Working with files</p>
<p>When working with files, you need to declare a pointer of type file. This declaration is needed for communication between the file and program.</p>

<h3>FILE *fptr;</h3>
<p>Opening a file - for creation and edit</p>
<p>Opening a file is performed using the library function in the "stdio.h" header file: fopen().</p>

<p><b>The syntax for opening a file in standard I/O is:</b></p>

<p>ptr = fopen("fileopen","mode")</p>
<p>For Example:</p>

<p>fopen("E:\\cprogram\\newprogram.txt","w");</p>

<p>fopen("E:\\cprogram\\oldprogram.bin","rb");</p>

<h3>Opening Modes in Standard I/O</h3>

<p>File Mode	Meaning of Mode	--During Inexistence of file</p>

<p>r	Open for reading.--	If the file does not exist, fopen() returns NULL.</p>

<p>rb	Open for reading in binary mode.--	If the file does not exist, fopen() returns NULL.</p>

<p>w	Open for writing.--	If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, it will be created.</p>

<p>wb	Open for writing in binary mode.--	If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, it will be created.</p>

<p>a	Open for append. i.e, Data is added to end of file.--	If the file does not exists, it will be created.</p>

<p>ab	Open for append in binary mode. i.e, Data is added to end of file.--	If the file does not exists, it will be created.</p>

<p>r+	Open for both reading and writing.--	If the file does not exist, fopen() returns NULL.</p>

<p>rb+	Open for both reading and writing in binary mode.--	If the file does not exist, fopen() returns NULL.</p>
</p>
<p>w+	Open for both reading and writing.--	If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, it will be created.</p>

<p>wb+	Open for both reading and writing in binary mode.--	If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, it will be created.</p>

<p>a+	Open for both reading and appending.	--If the file does not exists, it will be created.</p>

<p>ab+	Open for both reading and appending in binary mode.--	If the file does not exists, it will be created.
</p>
<h3>Closing a File</h3>
<p>The file (both text and binary) should be closed after reading/writing.</p>

<p>Closing a file is performed using library function fclose().</p>

<p>fclose(fptr); //fptr is the file pointer associated with file to be closed.</p>
<p>Reading and writing to a text file</p>
<p>For reading and writing to a text file, we use the functions fprintf() and fscanf().</p>

<p>They are just the file versions of printf() and scanf(). The only difference is that, fprint and fscanf expects a pointer to the structure FILE.</p>

<h3>Writing to a text file</h3>

<p>Example 1: Write to a text file using fprintf()</p>

<p>#include <stdio.h></p>
<p>int main()</p>
<p>{</p>
 <p>  int num;</p>
 <p>  FILE *fptr;</p>
  <p> fptr = fopen("C:\\program.txt","w");</p>

<p>   if(fptr == NULL)</p>
<p>   {</p>
   <p>   printf("Error!");   </p>
    <p>  exit(1);   </p>          
 <p>  }</p>

<p>   printf("Enter num: ");</p>
<p>   scanf("%d",&num);</p>

<p>   fprintf(fptr,"%d",num);</p>
<p>   fclose(fptr);</p>

 <p>  return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>


<h3>Reading from a text file</h3>
<p>Example 2: Read from a text file using fscanf()</p>

<p>#include <stdio.h></p>
<p>int main()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>   int num;</p>
  <p> FILE *fptr;</p>

  <p> if ((fptr = fopen("C:\\program.txt","r")) == NULL){</p>
  <p>     printf("Error! opening file");</p>

      <p> // Program exits if the file pointer returns NULL.</p>
       <p>exit(1);</p>
<p>   }</p>

<p>   fscanf(fptr,"%d", &num);</p>

  <p> printf("Value of n=%d", num);</p>
 <p>  fclose(fptr); </p>
  
  <p> return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>


<h3>Reading and writing to a binary file</h3>
<p>Functions fread() and fwrite() are used for reading from and writing to a file on the disk respectively in case of binary files.</p>

<h3>Writing to a binary file</h3>
<p>To write into a binary file, you need to use the function fwrite(). The functions takes four arguments: Address of data to be written in disk, Size of data to be written in disk, number of such type of data and pointer to the file where you want to write.</p>

<p>fwrite(address_data,size_data,numbers_data,pointer_to_file);</p>

<p><b>Example 3: Writing to a binary file using fwrite()</b></p>

<p>#include <stdio.h></p>

<p>struct threeNum</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>   int n1, n2, n3;</p>
<p>};</p>

<p>int main()</p>
<p>{</p>
 <p>  int n;</p>
  <p> struct threeNum num;</p>
  <p> FILE *fptr;</p>

 <p>  if ((fptr = fopen("C:\\program.bin","wb")) == NULL){</p>
  <p>     printf("Error! opening file");</p>

   <p>    // Program exits if the file pointer returns NULL.</p>
 <p>      exit(1);</p>
<p>   }</p>
<p>
   for(n = 1; n < 5; ++n)</p>
 <p>  {</p>
 <p>     num.n1 = n;</p>
     <p> num.n2 = 5n;</p>
    <p>  num.n3 = 5n + 1;</p>
    <p>  fwrite(&num, sizeof(struct threeNum), 1, fptr); </p>
<p>   }</p>
<p>   fclose(fptr); </p>
  
  <p> return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
