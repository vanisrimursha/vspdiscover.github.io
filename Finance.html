<h1>International Finance - Introduction</h1>

<p>International Finance is an important part of financial economics. It mainly discusses the issues related with monetary interactions of at least two or more countries. International finance is concerned with subjects such as exchange rates of currencies, monetary systems of the world, foreign direct investment (FDI), and other important issues associated with international financial management.</p>
<p>Like international trade and business, <b>international finance</b> exists due to the fact that economic activities of businesses, governments, and organizations get affected by the existence of nations. It is a known fact that countries often borrow and lend from each other. In such trades, many countries use their own currencies. Therefore, we must understand how the currencies compare with each other. Moreover, we should also have a good understanding of how these goods are paid for and what is the determining factor of the prices that the currencies trade at.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) are some of the notable international finance organizations.</p>
<p>International trade is one of the most important factors of growth and prosperity of participating economies. Its importance has got magnified many times due to globalization. Moreover, the resurgence of the US from being the biggest international creditor to become the largest international debtor is an important issue. These issues are a part of international macroeconomics, which is popularly known as international finance.</p>
<h2>Importance of International Finance</h2>
<p>International finance plays a critical role in international trade and inter-economy exchange of goods and services. It is important for a number of reasons, the most notable ones are listed here &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>International finance is an important tool to find the exchange rates, compare inflation rates, get an idea about investing in international debt securities, ascertain the economic status of other countries and judge the foreign markets.</p></li>
<li><p>Exchange rates are very important in international finance, as they let us determine the relative values of currencies. International finance helps in calculating these rates.</p></li>
<li><p>Various economic factors help in making international investment decisions. Economic factors of economies help in determining whether or not investors’ money is safe with foreign debt securities.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilizing <b>IFRS</b> is an important factor for many stages of international finance. Financial statements made by the countries that have adopted IFRS are similar. It helps many countries to follow similar reporting systems.</p></li>
<li><p>IFRS system, which is a part of international finance, also helps in saving money by following the rules of reporting on a single accounting standard.</p></li>
<li><p>International finance has grown in stature due to globalization. It helps understand the basics of all international organizations and keeps the balance intact among them.</p></li>
<li><p>An international finance system maintains peace among the nations. Without a solid finance measure, all nations would work for their self-interest. International finance helps in keeping that issue at bay.</p></li>
<li><p>International finance organizations, such as IMF, the World Bank, etc., provide a mediators’ role in managing international finance disputes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The very existence of an international financial system means that there are possibilities of international financial crises. This is where the study of international finance becomes very important. To know about the international financial crises, we have to understand the nature of the international financial system.</p>
<p>Without international finance, chances of conflicts and thereby, a resultant mess, is apparent. International finance helps keep international issues in a disciplined state.</p>

<h1>Balance of Payments</h1>

<p>It is important to measure the performance of an economy. <b>Balance of Payment</b> (BOP) is one way to do so. It shows the big picture of the total transactions of an economy with other economies. It takes the net inflows and outflows of money into account and then differentiates them into sections. It is important to balance all accounts of BOP in case of an imbalance so that the economic transactions can be measured and taken into account in a systematic and prudent manner.</p>
<p>Balance of Payment is a statement that shows an economy’s transactions with the remaining world in a given duration. Sometimes also called the balance of international payments, BOP includes each and every transaction between a nation’s residents and its nonresidents.</p>
<h2>Current Account and Capital Account</h2>
<p>All the transactions in BOP are classified into two accounts: the <b>current account</b> and the <b>capital account</b>.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Current account</b> &minus; It denotes the final net payment a nation is earning when it is in surplus, or spending when it is in deficit. It is obtained by adding the <b>balance of trade</b> (exports earnings minus imports expenses), <b>factor income</b> (foreign investment earning minus expenses for investment in a foreign country) and other <b>cash transfers</b>. The <i>current</i> word denotes that it covers transactions that are happening "here and now".</p></li>
<li><p><b>Capital account</b> &minus; It shows net change in foreign-asset-ownership of a nation. The capital account consists the <b>reserve</b> account (the net change of foreign exchange of a nation's central bank in market operations), <b>loans and investments</b> made by the nation (excluding the future interest payments and dividends yielded by loans and investments). If net foreign exchange is negative, the capital account is said to be in deficit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>BOP data does not include the real payments. Rather, it is involved with the transactions. This means that the figure of BOP may differ significantly from net payments made to an entity over a period of time.</p>
<p>BOP data is crucial in deciding the national and international economic policy. Part of the BOP, such as current account imbalances and foreign direct investment (FDI), are very important issues which are addressed in the economic policies of a nation. Economic policies with specific objectives impact the BOP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>The Tweak in Case of IMF</b></p>
<p>The IMF's BOP terminology uses the term "financial account" to include the transactions that would under alternative definitions be included in the general capital account. The IMF uses the term <b>capital account</b> for a subset of transactions that form a small part of the overall capital account. The IMF calculates the transactions in an additional top level division of the BOP accounts.</p>
<p>The BOP identity, according to IMF terminology, can be written as &minus;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Current account &plus; Financial account &plus; Capital account &plus; Balancing item = 0</p>
<p>According to IMF, the term <b>current account</b> has its own three leading sub-divisions, which are: the goods and services account (the overall trade balance), the primary income account (factor income), and the secondary income account (transfer payments).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Points to Note</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>BOP is an account to show the expenses made by consumers and firms on imported goods and services.</p></li>
<li><p>BOP is also a pointer to how much the successful firms of a country are exporting to foreign countries.</p></li>
<li><p>The money or the foreign currency entering a nation is taken as a positive entry (e.g. exports sold to foreign countries)</p></li>
<li><p>The money going out or expenses of foreign currency is adjusted as a negative entry (e.g. imports such as goods and services)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>BOP Imbalances</h2>
<p>BOP has to balance, however surpluses or deficits on its individual elements may create imbalances. There are concerns about deficits in the current account. The types of deficits that typically raise concerns are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A <i>visible trade deficit</i> in case of a nation that is importing significantly more goods than it exports.</p></li>
<li><p>An overall <i>current account deficit</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>A <i>basic deficit</i> which is the current account plus FDI, excluding short-term loans and the reserve account.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Reasons behind BOP Imbalances</h2>
<p>Conventionally, current account’s factors are thought to be the primary cause behind BOP imbalances – these include the exchange rate, the fiscal deficit, business competitiveness, and private behavior.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is believed that the capital account is the major driver of imbalances where a global savings satiation created by the savers in surplus countries goes ahead of the present investment opportunities.</p>
<h2>Reserve Assets</h2>
<p>BOP defines the reserve asset as the currency or other standard value that is used for their foreign reserves. The reserve asset can either be gold or the US Dollar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Global Reserves</b></p>
<p>According to IMF, between 2000 to mid-2009, official reserves increased from $1,900 billion to $6,800 billion. Global reserves were at the top, about $7,500 billion in mid-2008, then the reserves declined by about $430 billion during the financial crisis. From Feb 2009, global reserves increased again to reach $9,200 billion by the end of 2010.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>BOP Crisis</h2>
<p>A BOP crisis, or <b>currency crisis,</b> is the inability of a nation to pay for the necessary imports and/or return the pending debts. Such a crisis occurs with a very quick decline of the nation's currency value. Crises are generally preceded by large capital inflows.</p>
<h2>How to Correct BOP Imbalances</h2>
<p>There are three possible processes to correct BOP imbalances &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Adjustments of exchange rates,</li>
<li>Adjustment of nation’s internal prices along with its levels of demand, and</li>
<li>Rules-based adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rebalancing by Changing the Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>If a nation's currency price is increased, it will make exports less competitive and imports cheaper.</p>
<p>When a country is exporting more than what it imports, the demand for its currency will increase in foreign countries because other countries ultimately seek the country's currency to pay for the exports. Therefore, if the country is earning more, it will change (increase) the exchange rate to contain the current account surplus.</p>
<h3>Rebalancing by Adjusting Internal Prices and Demand</h3>
<p>A possible policy is to increase its level of internal demand (i.e. the nation’s expenditure on goods). An alternative expression for current account is that it is the excess of savings over investment. That is,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Current Account = National Savings – National Investment</p>
<p>When the Savings are in surplus, the nation can increase its investments. For example, in 2009, Germany amended its constitution to reduce its surplus by increasing demand.</p>
<h3>Rules-based rebalancing mechanisms</h3>
<p>Nations can also agree to determine the exchange rates against each other, and then try to correct the imbalances by rules-based and mutually negotiated exchange-rate changes.</p>
<p>The <b>Bretton Woods system</b> of fixed but adjustable exchange rates is an example of a rules-based system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Keynesian Idea for Rules-based Rebalancing</b></p>
<p>John Maynard Keynes believed that surpluses impose negative effects on the global economy. He suggested that traditional balancing mechanisms should add the threat of possession of a section of excess revenue if the surplus country chooses not to spend it on additional imports.</p>

<h1>International Money Market</h1>

<p>A <b>money market</b> is one of the safest financial markets available for currency transactions. It is often used by the big financial institutions, large corporations, and national governments. The investments made in money markets are usually for a very short period of time and therefore they are commonly known as <b>cash investments</b>.</p>
<h2>The International Money Market</h2>
<p>The international money market is a market where international currency transactions between numerous central banks of countries are carried on. The transactions are mainly carried out using gold or in US dollar as a base. The basic operations of the international money market include the money borrowed or lent by the governments or the large financial institutions.</p>
<p>The international money market is governed by the transnational monetary transaction policies of various nations’ currencies. The international money market’s major responsibility is to handle the currency trading between the countries. This process of trading a country’s currency with another one is also known as <b>forex trading</b>.</p>
<p>Unlike share markets, the international money market sees very large funds transfer. The players of the market are not individuals; they are very big financial institutions. The international money market investments are less risky and consequently, the returns obtained from the investments are less too. The best and most popular investment method in the international money market is via <b>money market mutual funds</b> or <b>treasury bills</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The international money market handles huge sums of international currency trading on a daily basis. The Bank for International Settlements has revealed that the daily turnover of a traditional exchange market is about $1880 billion.</p>
<p>Some of the major international money market participants are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Citigroup</li>
<li>Deutsche Bank</li>
<li>HSBC</li>
<li>Barclays Capital</li>
<li>UBS AG</li>
<li>Royal Bank of Scotland</li>
<li>Bank of America</li>
<li>Goldman Sachs</li>
<li>Merrill Lynch</li>
<li>JP Morgan Chase</li>
</ul>
<p>The international money market keeps track of the exchange rates between currency- pairs on a regular basis. Currency bands, fixed exchange rate, exchange rate regime, linked exchange rates, and floating exchange rates are the common indices that govern the international money market in a subtle manner.</p>
<h2>The International Monetary Market</h2>
<p>The International Monetary Market (IMM) was formed in December 1971 and was established in May 1972. The roots of IMM can be linked to the finish of Bretton Woods via the 1971 Smithsonian Agreement and then, Nixon's abolition of US dollar's convertibility to gold.</p>
<p>The IMM was formed as a separate entity of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). By the end of 2009, IMM was the second biggest futures exchange in terms of currency volume in the world. The major purpose of the IMM is to trade currency futures. It is comparatively a new product which was earlier studied by the academics as a tool to operate a freely-traded exchange market to initiate trade among the nations.</p>
<p>The first futures transactions included trades of currencies against the US dollar, such as the British Pound, Swiss Franc, German Deutschmark, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, and the French Franc. The Australian Dollar, the Euro, emerging market currencies such as the Russian Ruble, Brazilian Real, Turkish Lira, Hungarian Forint, Polish Zloty, Mexican Peso, and South African Rand were later introduced as well.</p>
<h2>The Drawbacks of Currency Futures</h2>
<p>The challenge of the IMM was in connecting the values of IMM foreign exchange contracts to the interbank market, which is the prominent means of currency trading in the 1970s. The other aspect was how to allow the IMM to become the best and a free-floating exchange.</p>
<p>To contain these aspects, clearing member-firms were allowed to act as the arbitrageurs between central banks and the IMM to allow orderly markets between the bid and ask spreads.</p>
<p>Later on, the Continental Bank of Chicago was incorporated as a delivery agent for contracts. These initial successes led to fierce competition for new futures products.</p>
<p>The Chicago Board Options Exchange was a competitor. It had received the right to trade US 30-year bond futures while the IMM obtained the official right to trade Eurodollar contracts. The Eurodollars were a 90-day interest rate contract settled in cash and not in any physical delivery.</p>
<p>Eurodollars later became the "Eurocurrency Market," which were mainly used by the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC required payment for oil in US dollars.</p>
<p>This cash settlement aspect later introduced index futures known as IMM Index. Cash settlements also allowed the IMM to later known as a "cash market" because the trades were interest rate sensitive instruments of short-term.</p>
<h2>A System for Transactions</h2>
<p>As competition grew, a transaction-system to handle the transactions in IMM was required. The CME and Reuters Holdings introduced Post Market Trade (PMT) for worldwide electronic automated transactions. The system became the single clearing entity to link the major financial centres like Tokyo and London.</p>
<p>Now, PMT is called <b>Globex,</b> which deals not only in clearing but also in electronic trading for traders around the world. In 1976, US T-bills began trading on the IMM. T-bill futures were introduced in April 1986 that was approved by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<h2>Financial Crises and Liquidity</h2>
<p>In financial crises, central banks need to provide liquidity to stabilize markets, as risks may trade at premiums (money rates) to a bank's target rates. Central bankers then need to infuse liquidity to the banks that trade and control rates. These are known as <b>repo rates,</b> and these are traded via IMM.</p>
<p>Repo markets allow the participating banks to offer rapid refinancing in the interbank market that is independent of any credit limits to smoothen the market.</p>
<p>A borrower has to pledge for securitized assets, such as equity, in exchange for cash to allow its operations to continue.</p>
<hr />


<h1>International Bond Markets</h1>

<p>Unlike Equity and Money markets, there is no specific bond market to trade bonds. However, there are domestic and foreign participants who sell and buy bonds in various bond markets.</p>
<p>A bond market is much larger than equity markets, and the investments are huge too. However, bonds pay on maturity and they are traded for short-time before maturity in the markets.</p>
<p>Bonds also have risks, returns, indices, and volatility factors like equity and money markets. The international bond market is composed of three separate types of bond markets: <b>Domestic Bonds, Foreign Bonds,</b> and <b>Eurobonds</b>.</p>
<h2>Domestic Bonds</h2>
<p>Domestic bonds trade is a part of the international bond market. Domestic bonds are dealt in local basis and domestic borrowers issue the local bonds. Domestic bonds are bought and sold in local currency.</p>
<h2>Foreign Bonds</h2>
<p>In foreign bond market, bonds are issued by foreign borrowers. Foreign bonds normally use the local currency. The concerned local market authorities supervise the issuance and sale of foreign bonds.</p>
<p>Foreign bonds are traded in the foreign bond markets. Some special characteristics of the foreign bond markets are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Issuers of bonds are usually governments and private sector utilities.</li>
<li>It is a standard practice to underwrite and organize underwriting the risks.</li>
<li>Issues are generally pledged by the retail and the institutional investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past, Continental private banks and old merchant houses in London linked the investors with the issuers.</p>
<h2>Eurobonds</h2>
<p>Eurobonds are not sold in any specific national bond market. A group of multinational banks issue Eurobonds. A Eurobond of any currency is sold outside the nation that has the currency. A Eurobond in the US dollar would not be sold in the United States.</p>
<p>The <b>Euromarket</b> is the trading place of Eurobonds, Eurocurrency, Euronotes, Eurocommercial Papers, and Euroequity. It is commonly an offshore market.</p>
<h2>International Bond market participants</h2>
<p>Bond market participants are either buyers (debt issuer) or sellers (institution) of funds and often both of these. Participants include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Institutional investors</li>
<li>Governments</li>
<li>Traders</li>
<li>Individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>Since there is a specificity of individual bond issues, and a condition of lack of liquidity in case of many smaller issues, a significantly larger chunk of outstanding bonds are often held by institutions, such as pension funds, banks, and mutual funds. In the United States, the private individuals own about 10% of the market.</p>
<h2>International Bond Market Size</h2>
<p>Amounts outstanding on the global bond market on March 2012 were about $100 trillion. That means in March 2012, the bond market was much larger than the global equity market that accounted for a market capitalization of around $53 trillion.</p>
<p>The outstanding value of international bonds in 2011 was about $30 trillion. There was a total issuance of $1.2 trillion in the year, which was down by around one fifth of the 2010’s total. In 2012, the first half saw a strong start with issuance of over $800 billion.</p>
<h2>International Bond Market Volatility</h2>
<p>For the market participants owning bonds, collecting coupons and holding it till maturity, <b>market volatility</b> is not a matter to ponder over. The principal and interest rates are pre-determined for them.</p>
<p>However, participants who trade bonds before maturity face many risks, including the most important one – changes in interest rates. When interest rates increase, the bond-value falls. Therefore, changes in bond prices are inversely proportional to the changes in interest rates.</p>
<p>Economic indicators and paring with actual data usually contribute to market volatility. Only little price movement is seen after the release of "in-line" data. When economic release does not match the consensus view, a rapid price movement is seen in the market. Uncertainty is responsible for more volatility.</p>
<h2>Bond Investments</h2>
<p>Bonds have (generally) $1,000 increments. Bonds are priced as a percentage of par value. Many bonds have minimums imposed on them.</p>
<p>Bonds pay interests at given intervals. Bonds with fixed coupons usually divide the coupon according to the payment schedule. Bonds with floating rate coupons have set calculation schedules. The rate is calculated just before the next payment. Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount, but they don’t pay interests.</p>
<p>Bond interest is taxed, but in contrast to dividend income that receives favorable taxation rates, they are taxed as ordinary. Many government bonds are, however, exempt from taxation.</p>
<p>Individual investors can participate through bond funds, closed-end funds, and unit-investment trusts offered by investment companies.</p>
<h2>Bond Indices</h2>
<p>A number of bond indices exist. The common American benchmarks include Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index, Citigroup BIG, and Merrill Lynch Domestic Master.</p>
<hr />


<h1>International Equity Markets</h1>

<p>International equity markets are an important platform for global finance. They not only ensure the participation of a wide variety of participants but also offer global economies to prosper.</p>
<p>To understand the importance of international equity markets, market valuations and turnovers are important tools. Moreover, we must also learn how these markets are composed and the elements that govern them. Cross-listing, Yankee stocks, ADRs and GRS are important elements of equity markets.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss all these aspects along with the returns from international equity markets.</p>
<h2>Market Structure, Trading Practices, and Costs</h2>
<p>The <b>secondary equity markets</b> provide marketability and share valuation. Investors or traders who purchase shares from the issuing company in the primary market may not desire to own them forever. The secondary market permits the shareholders to reduce the ownership of unwanted shares and lets the purchasers to buy the stock.</p>
<p>The secondary market consists of brokers who represent the public buyers and sellers. There are two kinds of orders &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Market order</b> &minus; A market order is traded at the best price available in the market, which is the market price.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Limit order</b> &minus; A limit order is held in a limit order book until the desired price is obtained.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different designs for secondary markets. A secondary market is structured as a dealer market or an agency market.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In a <b>dealer market,</b> the broker takes the trade through the dealer. Public traders do not directly trade with one another in a dealer market. The over-the-counter (OTC) market is a dealer market.</p></li>
<li><p>In an <b>agency market,</b> the broker gets client’s orders via an agent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not all stock market systems provide <b>continuous trading</b>. For example, the <b>Paris Bourse</b> was traditionally a <b>call market</b> where an agent gathers a batch of orders that are periodically executed throughout the trading day. The major disadvantage of a call market is that the traders do not know the bid and ask quotations prior to the call.</p>
<p><b>Crowd trading</b> is a form of <b>non-continuous</b> trade. In crowd trading, in a trading ring, an agent periodically announces the issue. The traders then announce their bid and ask prices, and look for counterparts to a trade. Unlike a call market which has a common price for all trades, several trades may occur at different prices.</p>
<h2>Trading In International Equities</h2>
<p>A greater global integration of capital markets became apparent for various reasons &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>First, investors understood the good effects of international trade.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, the prominent capital markets got more liberalized through the elimination of fixed trading commissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Third, internet and information and communication technology facilitated efficient and fair trading in international stocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth, the MNCs understood the advantages of sourcing new capital internationally.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Cross-listing</h3>
<p>Cross-listing refers to having the shares listed on one or more foreign exchanges. In particular, MNCs do this generally, but non-MNCs also cross-list. A firm may decide to cross-list its shares for the following reasons &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Cross-listing provides a way to expand the investor’s base, thus potentially increasing its demand in a new market.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross-listing offers recognition of the company in a new capital market, thus allowing the firm to source new equity or debt capital from local investors.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross-listing offers more investors. International portfolio diversification is possible for investors when they trade on their own stock exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross-listing may be seen as a signal to investors that improved corporate governance is imminent.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross-listing diminishes the probability of a hostile takeover of the firm via the broader investor base formed for the firm’s shares.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Yankee Stock Offerings</h2>
<p>In 1990s, many international companies, including the Latin Americans, have listed their stocks on U.S. exchanges to prime market for future Yankee stock offerings, that is, the direct sale of new equity capital to U.S. public investors. One of the reasons is the pressure for privatization of companies. Another reason is the rapid growth in the economies. The third reason is the expected large demand for new capital after the NAFTA has been approved.</p>
<h2>American Depository Receipts (ADR)</h2>
<p>An ADR is a receipt that has a number of foreign shares remaining on deposit with the U.S. depository’s custodian in the issuer’s home market. The bank is a transfer agent for the ADRs that are traded in the United States exchanges or in the OTC market.</p>
<p>ADRs offer various investment advantages. These advantages include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>ADRs are denominated in dollars, trade on a US stock exchange, and can be purchased through the investor’s regular broker. This is easier than purchasing and trading in US stocks by entering the US exchanges.</p></li>
<li><p>Dividends received on the shares are issued in dollars by the custodian and paid to the ADR investor, and a currency conversion is not required.</p></li>
<li><p>ADR trades clear in three business days as do U.S. equities, whereas settlement of underlying stocks vary in other countries.</p></li>
<li><p>ADR price quotes are in U.S. dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>ADRs are registered securities and they offer protection of ownership rights. Most other underlying stocks are bearer securities.</p></li>
<li><p>An ADR can be sold by trading the ADR to another investor in the US stock market, and shares can also be sold in the local stock market.</p></li>
<li><p>ADRs frequently represent a set of underlying shares. This allows the ADR to trade in a price range meant for US investors.</p></li>
<li><p>ADR owners can provide instructions to the depository bank to vote the rights.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two types of ADRs: <b>sponsored</b> and <b>unsponsored</b>.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Sponsored ADRs</b> are created by a bank after a request of the foreign company. The sponsoring bank offers lots of services, including investment information and the annual report translation. Sponsored ADRs are listed on the US stock markets. New ADR issues must be sponsored.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Unsponsored ADRs</b> are generally created on request of US investment banking firms without any direct participation of the foreign issuing firm.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Global Registered Shares (GRS)</h2>
<p>GRS are a share that are traded globally, unlike the ADRs that are receipts of the bank deposits of home-market shares and are traded on foreign markets. The GRS are fully transferrable — GRS purchased on one exchange can be sold on another. They usually trade in both US dollars and euros.</p>
<p>The main advantage of GRS over ADRs is that all shareholders have equal status and the direct voting rights. The main disadvantage is the cost of establishing the global registrar and the clearing facility.</p>
<h2>Factors Affecting International Equity Returns</h2>
<p>Macroeconomic factors, exchange rates, and industrial structures affect international equity returns.</p>
<h3>Macroeconomic Factors</h3>
<p>Solnik (1984) examined the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate differences, the domestic interest rate, and changes in domestic inflation expectations. He found that international monetary variables had only weak influence on equity returns. Asprem (1989) stated that fluctuations in industrial production, employment, imports, interest rates, and an inflation measure affect a small portion of the equity returns.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Adler and Simon (1986) tested the sample of foreign equity and bond index returns to exchange rate changes. They found that exchange rate changes generally had a variability of foreign bond indexes than foreign equity indexes. However, some foreign equity markets were more vulnerable to exchange rate changes than the foreign bond markets.</p>
<h3>Industrial Structure</h3>
<p>Roll (1992) concluded that the industrial structure of a country was important in explaining a significant part of the correlation structure of international equity index returns.</p>
<p>In contrast, Eun and Resnick (1984) found that the correlation structure of international security returns could be better estimated by recognized country factors rather than industry factors.</p>
<p>Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994) stated that “industrial structure explains very little of the cross-sectional difference in country returns volatility, and that the low correlation between country indices is almost completely due to country-specific sources of variation.”</p>

<h1>Foreign Currency Futures &amp; Options</h1>

<p>Depending on the selection of buying or selling the numerator or denominator of a currency pair, the derivative contracts are known as <b>futures</b> and <b>options</b>.</p>
<p>There are various ways to earn a profit from futures and options, but the contract-holder is always obliged to certain rules when they go into a contract.</p>
<p>There are some basic differences between futures and options and these differences are the ways through which investors can make a profit or a loss.</p>
<h2>Long and Short Currency Trading</h2>
<p>Currency futures and options are derivative contracts. These contracts derive their own values from utilization of the underlying assets, which, in this case, are currency pairs. Currencies are always traded in pairs.</p>
<p>For example, the Euro and U.S. Dollar pair is expressed as EUR/USD. When someone buys this pair, they are said to be going long (buying) with the numerator, or the base, currency, which is the Euro; and thereby selling the denominator (quote) currency, which is the Dollar. When someone sells the pair, it is selling the Euro and buying the Dollar. When the long currency appreciates against the short currency, people make money.</p>
<h2>Foreign Currency Futures</h2>
<p>Currency futures make the buyer of the contract to buy the long currency (numerator) by paying with the short currency (denominator) for it. The seller of a contract has the reverse obligation. The obligation of the contact is usually due on the expiration date of the future.</p>
<p>The ratio of currencies, bought and sold, is settled in advance between the parties involved. People make a profit or loss depending on the gap between the settled price and the real, effective price on the date of expiration.</p>
<p>Margins are deposited for the futures trades – cash is the important part that serves as the performance bond to make sure that both parties are obliged to fulfil their obligations.</p>
<h2>Options on Currency Pairs</h2>
<p>The party that purchases a currency pair call option may also decide to settle for an execution or to sell out the option on or before the date of expiration. There is a <b>strike price</b> of the option that shows a particular exchange ratio for the given pair of currencies.</p>
<p>When the actual price of the currency pair is more than the strike price, the call holder earns a profit. It is said to execute the option by buying the base and selling the quote at a profitable term. A put buyer always bets on the denominator or quote currency appreciating against the numerator or the base currency.</p>
<h2>Options on Currency Futures</h2>
<p>Instead of having to buy and sell currency pairs, options in a currency future offers the contract-holders the right, but not an obligation, to purchase a futures contract on the particular currency pair.</p>
<p>The strategy in such a case is that the option buyer can profit from the futures market without having to put down any margin in the contract. When the futures contract appreciate, the call or contract holder can just sell the call for a profit. The call holder does not need to buy the underlying futures contract. A put buyer can easily earn a profit if the futures contract loses value.</p>
<h2>Difference between Options and Futures</h2>
<p>The basic and most prominent difference between options and futures is related with the obligations they create on part of the buyers and sellers.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>An <b>option</b> offers the buyer the basic right, <i>but not an obligation,</i> to buy (or sell) a certain kind of asset at a decided or settled price, which is specific at any time while the contract is alive.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, a <b>futures</b> contract offers the buyer the obligation to buy a specific asset, and the seller the obligation to sell and deliver that asset on a specific future date, provided the holder does not close the position prior to expiration.</p></li>
<li><p>An investor can go in into a futures contract with no upfront cost apart from commissions, whereas purchasing an options position does not need to pay a premium. While comparing the absence of any upfront cost of futures, the premium of the option can be considered as the fee for not being obligated to purchase the underlying asset in the case of an adverse movement in prices. The premium paid on the option is the maximum value a purchaser can lose.</p></li>
<li><p>Another important difference between futures and options is the size of the given or underlying position. Usually, the underlying position is considerably bigger in case of futures contracts. Moreover, the obligation to purchase or sell this given amount at a settled price turns the futures a bit riskier for an inexperienced investor.</p></li>
<li><p>The final and one of the prominent differences between futures and options is the way the gains or earnings are obtained by the parties. In case of an option, the gains can be realized in the following three ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Exercising the option when it is deep in the money,</p></li>
<li><p>Going to the market and taking the opposite position, or</p></li>
<li><p>Waiting until expiry and gaining the gap between the asset and the strike prices.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, gains on the futures positions are naturally 'marked to market' every day. This means that the change in the price of the positions is assigned to the futures accounts of the parties at the end of every trading day. However, a futures call-holder can also realize gains by going to the market and opting for the opposite position.</p>

<h1>Foreign Direct Investment</h1>

<p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important factor in acquiring investments and grow the local market with foreign finances when local investment is unavailable. There are various formats of FDI and companies should do a good research before actually investing in a foreign country.</p>
<p>It has been proved that FDI can be a win-win situation for both the parties involved. The investor can gain cheaper access to products/services and the host country can get valuable investment unattainable locally.</p>
<p>There are various vehicles through which FDI can be acquired and there are some important questions the firms must answer before actually implementing a FDI strategy.</p>
<h2>FDI – Definition</h2>
<p>FDI, in its classic definition, is termed as a company of one nation putting up a physical investment into building a facility (factory) in another country. The direct investment made to create the buildings, machinery, and equipment is not in sync with making a portfolio investment, an indirect investment.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to fast growth and change in global investment patterns, the definition has been expanded to include all the acquisition activities outside the investing firm’s home country.</p>
<p>FDI, therefore, may take many forms, such as direct acquisition of a foreign firm, constructing a facility, or investing in a joint venture or making a strategic alliance with one of the local firms with an input of technology, licensing of intellectual property.</p>
<h2>FDI and its Types</h2>
<p>Strategically, FDI comes in three types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Horizontal</b> &minus; In case of horizontal FDI, the company does all the same activities abroad as at home. For example, Toyota assembles motor cars in Japan and the UK.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Vertical</b> &minus; In vertical assignments, different types of activities are carried out abroad. In case of <b>forward vertical FDI,</b> the FDI brings the company nearer to a market (for example, Toyota buying a car distributorship in America). In case of <b>backward Vertical FDI</b>, the international integration goes back towards raw materials (for example, Toyota getting majority stake in a tyre manufacturer or a rubber plantation).</p></li>
<li><p><b>Conglomerate</b> &minus; In this type of investment, the investment is made to acquire an unrelated business abroad. It is the most surprising form of FDI, as it requires overcoming two barriers simultaneously – one, entering a foreign country and two, working in a new industry.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>FDI can take the form of <b>greenfield entry</b> or <b>takeover</b>.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Greenfield</b> entry refers to activities or assembling all the elements right from scratch as Honda did in the UK.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Foreign takeover</b> means acquiring an existing foreign company – as Tata’s acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover. Foreign takeover is often called <b>mergers and acquisitions</b> (M&amp;A) but internationally, mergers are absolutely small, which accounts for less than 1% of all foreign acquisitions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This choice of entry in a market and its mode interacts with the ownership strategy. The choice of wholly owned subsidiaries against joint ventures gives a 2x2 matrix of choices – the options of which are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Greenfield wholly owned ventures,</li>
<li>Greenfield joint ventures,</li>
<li>Wholly owned takeovers, and</li>
<li>Joint foreign acquisitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These choices offer foreign investors options to match their own interests, capabilities, and foreign conditions.</p>
<h2>Why is FDI Important?</h2>
<p>FDI is an important source of externally derived finance that offers countries with limited amounts of capital get finance beyond national borders from wealthier countries. For example, exports and FDI are the two key ingredients in China's rapid economic growth.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, FDI is one of the critical elements in developing the private sector in lower-income economies and thereby, in reducing poverty.</p>
<h3>Vehicles of FDI</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Reciprocal distribution agreements</b> &minus; This type of strategic alliance is found more in trade-based verticals, but in practical sense, it does represent a type of direct investment. Basically, two companies, usually within the same or affiliated industries, but from different nations, agree to become national distributors for each other’s products.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Joint venture and other hybrid strategic alliances</b> &minus; Traditional joint venture is bilateral, involving two parties who are within the same industry, partnering for getting some strategic advantage. Joint ventures and strategic alliances offer access to proprietary technology, gaining access to intellectual capital as human resources, and access to closed channels of distribution in select locations.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Portfolio investment</b> &minus; For most of the 20th century, a company’s portfolio investments were not considered a direct investment. However, two or three companies with "soft" investments in a company could try to find some mutual interests and use their shareholding for management control. This is another form of strategic alliance, sometimes called <b>shadow alliances</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>FDI – Basic Requirements</h2>
<p>As a minimum requirement, a firm will have to keep itself abreast of global trends in its industry. From a competitive perspective, it is important to be aware if the competitors are getting into a foreign market and how they do that.</p>
<p>It is also important to see how globalization is currently affecting the domestic clients. Often, it becomes imperative to expand for key clients overseas for an active business relationship.</p>
<p>New market access is also another major reason to invest in a foreign country. At some stage, export of product or service becomes obsolete and foreign production or location becomes more cost effective. Any decision on investing is thus a combination of a number of key factors including &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>assessment of internal resources,</li>
<li>competitiveness,</li>
<li>market analysis, and</li>
<li>market expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>A firm should seek answers to the following seven questions before investing abroad &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>From an internal resources standpoint, does the firm have senior management support and the internal management and system capabilities to support the setup time and an ongoing management of a foreign subsidiary?</p></li>
<li><p>Has the company done enough market research in the domains, including industry, product, and local regulations governing foreign investment?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a realistic judgement in place of what level of resource utilization the investment will offer?</p></li>
<li><p>Has information on local industry and foreign investment regulations, incentives, profit sharing, financing, distribution, etc., completely analyzed to determine the most suitable vehicle for FDI?</p></li>
<li><p>Has an adequate plan been made considering reasonable expectations for expansion into the foreign market via the local vehicle?</p></li>
<li><p>If applicable, have all the relevant government agencies been contacted and concurred?</p></li>
<li><p>Have political risk and foreign exchange risk been judged and considered in the business plan?</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Long-Term &amp; Short-Term Financing</h1>

<p>Financing is a very important part of every business. Firms often need financing to pay for their assets, equipment, and other important items. Financing can be either long-term or short-term. As is obvious, long-term financing is more expensive as compared to short-term financing.</p>
<p>There are different vehicles through which long-term and short-term financing is made available. This chapter deals with the major vehicles of both types of financing.</p>
<p>The common sources of financing are capital that is generated by the firm itself and sometimes, it is capital from external funders, which is usually obtained after issuance of new debt and equity.</p>
<p>A firm’s management is responsible for matching the long-term or short-term financing mix. This mix is applicable to the assets that are to be financed as closely as possible, regarding timing and cash flows.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Financing</h2>
<p>Long-term financing is usually needed for acquiring new equipment, R&amp;D, cash flow enhancement, and company expansion. Some of the major methods for long-term financing are discussed below.</p>
<h3>Equity Financing</h3>
<p>Equity financing includes preferred stocks and common stocks. This method is less risky in respect to cash flow commitments. However, equity financing often results in dissolution of share ownership and it also decreases earnings.</p>
<p>The cost associated with equity is generally higher than the cost associated with debt, which is again a deductible expense. Therefore, equity financing can also result in an enhanced hurdle rate that may cancel any reduction in the cash flow risk.</p>
<h3>Corporate Bond</h3>
<p>A corporate bond is a special kind of bond issued by any corporation to collect money effectively in an aim to expand its business. This tern is usually used for long-term debt instruments that generally have a maturity date after one year after their issue date at the minimum.</p>
<p>Some corporate bonds may have an associated call option that permits the issuer to redeem it before it reaches the maturity. All other types of bonds that are known as <b>convertible bonds</b> that offer investors the option to convert the bond to equity.</p>
<h3>Capital Notes</h3>
<p>Capital notes are a type of convertible security that are exercisable into shares. They are one type of equity vehicle. Capital notes resemble warrants, except the fact that they usually don’t have the expiry date or an exercise price. That is why the entire consideration the company aims to receive, for the future issuance of the shares, is generally paid at the time of issuance of capital notes.</p>
<p>Many times, capital notes are issued with a debt-for-equity swap restructuring. Instead of offering the shares (that replace debt) in the present, the company provides its creditors with convertible securities – the capital notes – and hence the dilution occurs later.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Financing</h2>
<p>Short-term financing with a time duration of up to one year is used to help corporations increase inventory orders, payrolls, and daily supplies. Short-term financing can be done using the following financial instruments &minus;</p>
<h3>Commercial Paper</h3>
<p>Commercial Paper is an unsecured promissory note with a pre-noted maturity time of 1 to 364 days in the global money market. Originally, it is issued by large corporations to raise money to meet the short-term debt obligations.</p>
<p>It is backed by the bank that issues it or by the corporation that promises to pay the face value on maturity. Firms with excellent credit ratings can sell their commercial papers at a good price.</p>
<p><b>Asset-backed commercial paper</b> (ABCP) is collateralized by other financial assets. ABCP is a very short-term instrument with 1 and 180 days’ maturity from issuance. ACBCP is typically issued by a bank or other financial institution.</p>
<h3>Promissory Note</h3>
<p>It is a negotiable instrument where the maker or issuer makes an issue-less promise in writing to pay back a pre-decided sum of money to the payee at a fixed maturity date or on demand of the payee, under specific terms.</p>
<h3>Asset-based Loan</h3>
<p>It is a type of loan, which is often short term, and is secured by a company's assets. Real estate, accounts receivable (A/R), inventory and equipment are the most common assets used to back the loan. The given loan is either backed by a single category of assets or by a combination of assets.</p>
<h3>Repurchase Agreements</h3>
<p>Repurchase agreements are extremely short-term loans. They usually have a maturity of less than two weeks and most frequently they have a maturity of just one day! Repurchase agreements are arranged by selling securities with an agreement to purchase them back at a fixed cost on a given date.</p>
<h3>Letter of Credit</h3>
<p>A financial institution or a similar party issues this document to a seller of goods or services. The seller provides that the issuer will definitely pay the seller for goods or services delivered to a third-party buyer.</p>
<p>The issuer then seeks reimbursement to be met by the buyer or by the buyer's bank. The document is in fact a guarantee offered to the seller that it will be paid on time by the issuer of the letter of credit, even if the buyer fails to pay.</p>

<h1>Working Capital Management</h1>

<p>Working capital management is associated with receiving and paying out cash. As is obvious, the companies tend to maximize the benefits of earning by paying as late as possible and getting paid as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This chapter provides various ways to maximize the benefits of working capital management and offers practical examples to understand the concepts.</p>
<h2>Why Firms Hold Cash</h2>
<p>Economist John Maynard Keynes suggested three main reasons why firms hold cash. The three reasons are for the purpose of speculation, precaution, and transactions. All of these three reasons arise from the necessity of companies to possess liquidity.</p>
<h3>Speculation</h3>
<p>According to Keynes, speculation for holding cash is seen as creating the ability for a firm to take the benefits of special opportunities. These opportunities, if acted upon quickly, tend to favor the firm. An example of speculation is purchasing extra inventory at a discounted rate. This rate is usually far greater than the carrying costs of holding the inventory.</p>
<h3>Precaution</h3>
<p>A precaution serves as a protectionist or emergency fund for a company. When the cash inflows are not received according to expectation, cash held on a precautionary basis can be utilized to satisfy the short-term obligations for which cash inflow may have been sought for.</p>
<h3>Transaction</h3>
<p>Firms either create products or they provide services. The offer of services and creation of products results in the necessity for cash inflows and outflows. Firms may hold enough cash to satisfy their cash inflow and cash outflow needs that arise from time to time.</p>
<h2>Float</h2>
<p>Float is the existing difference between the given book balance and the actual bank balance of an account. For example, you open a bank account, say, with $500. You do not receive any interest on the $500 and you also do not pay a fee to have the account.</p>
<p>Now, think what you do when you get a utility or water bill. You receive your water bill and say, it is for $100. You can write a check for $100 and then mail it to the particular water company. When you write the $100 check, you also file the transaction or payment in the bank register. The value your bank register reflects is the book value of the account. The check may be "in the mail" for a few days. Then after the water company receives, it may take several more days before it is cashed.</p>
<p>Now, between the moment you initiate or write the check and the moment the bank cashes the check, there will obviously be a difference in the book balance and the balance your bank lists for your checking account. That difference is known as <b>float</b>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the float can be managed. If you already have the info that the bank will not get to know about your check for five days, you could also invest the $100 in a savings account at the bank for the five days. Then at the "just in time" you can replace the $100 in your checking account to cover the $100 check.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th width="35%">Time</th>
<th width="25%">Book Balance</th>
<th>Bank Balance</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Time 0 (make deposit)</td>
<td>$500</td>
<td>$500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Time 1 (write $100 check)</td>
<td>$400</td>
<td>$500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Time 2 (bank receives check)</td>
<td>$400</td>
<td>$400</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Float is calculated by subtracting the book balance from the bank balance.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Float at Time 0: $500 &minus; $500 = $0</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Float at Time 1: $500 &minus; $400 = $100</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Float at Time 2: $400 &minus; $400 = $0</p>
<h2>Ways to Manage Cash</h2>
<p>Firms need to manage cash in almost all areas of operations that have anything to do with cash. The goal of the firm is to get cash as soon as possible and at the same time, keep waiting to pay the cash out as long as possible. Some of the examples of how firms do this are discussed below.</p>
<h3>Policy for Cash Being Held</h3>
<p>A firm holding the cash tries to maximize its benefits and want to pay out the cash until the last possible moment. An example is given here.</p>
<p>In the last bank account example, say, you invest $500 in liquid investments rather than investing that amount in a checking account that pays no interest. Assume that the bank allows you to maintain a balance of $0 in your checking account.</p>
<p>Now, you can write a $100 check to the Water Company and then transfer funds in "just in time" (JIT) fashion. By employing this JIT system, you will get interest on the entire $500 till you need the $100 to pay the water company.</p>
<p>Firms often have such policies to maximize idle cash.</p>
<h3>Sales</h3>
<p>The goal here is to shorten the time to receive the cash as much as possible. Firms that make sales on credit tend to decrease the amount of time customers wait to pay the firm by offering discounts.</p>
<p>For example, credit sales are often made with terms such as 3/10 net 60. It means that a 3% discount on the sale when the payment is made within 10 days. The "net 60," term means that the bill is due within 60 days.</p>
<h3>Inventory</h3>
<p>The goal now is to put off the payment of cash for as long as possible and to manage the cash being held. By using a JIT inventory system, a firm can delay paying for inventory until it is needed. The firm also avoids carrying costs on the inventory. The companies buy raw materials in JIT systems.</p>

<h1>International Trade Finance</h1>

<p>International trade financing is required especially to get funds to carry out international trade operations. Depending on the types and attributes of financing, there are five major methods of transactions in international trade. In this chapter, we will discuss the methods of transactions and finance normally utilized in international trade and investment operations.</p>
<h2>International Trade Payment Methods</h2>
<p>The five major processes of transaction in international trade are the following &minus;</p>
<h3>Prepayment</h3>
<p>Prepayment occurs when the payment of a debt or installment payment is done before the due date. A prepayment can include the entire balance or any upcoming part of the entire payment paid in advance of the due date. In prepayment, the borrower is obligated by a contract to pay for the due amount. Examples of prepayment include rent or loan repayments.</p>
<h3>Letter of Credit</h3>
<p>A Letter of Credit is a letter from a bank that guarantees that the payment due by the buyer to a seller will be made timely and for the given amount. In case the buyer cannot make payment, the bank will cover the entire or remaining portion of the payment.</p>
<h3>Drafts</h3>
<p><b>Sight Draft</b> &minus; It is a kind of bill of exchange, where the exporter owns the title to the transported goods until the importer acknowledges and pays for them. Sight drafts are usually found in case of air shipments and ocean shipments for financing the transactions of goods in case of international trade.</p>
<p><b>Time Draft</b> &minus; It is a type of foreign check guaranteed by the bank. However, it is not payable in full until the duration of time after it is obtained and accepted. In fact, time drafts are a short-term credit vehicle used for financing goods’ transactions in international trade.</p>
<h3>Consignment</h3>
<p>It is an arrangement to leave the goods in the possession of another party to sell. Typically, the party that sells receives a good percentage of the sale. Consignments are used to sell a variety of products including artwork, clothing, books, etc. Recently, consignment dealers have become quite trendy, such as those offering specialty items, infant clothing, and luxurious fashion items.</p>
<h3>Open Account</h3>
<p>Open account is a method of making payments for various trade transactions. In this arrangement, the supplier ships the goods to the buyer. After receiving and checking the concerned shipping documents, the buyer credits the supplier's account in their own books with the required invoice amount.</p>
<p>The account is then usually settled periodically; say monthly, by sending bank drafts by the buyer, or arranging through wire transfers and air mails in favor of the exporter.</p>
<h2>Trade Finance Methods</h2>
<p>The most popular trade financing methods are the following &minus;</p>
<h3>Accounts Receivable Financing</h3>
<p>It is a special type of asset-financing arrangement. In such an arrangement, a company utilizes the receivables – the money owed by the customers – as a collateral in getting a finance.</p>
<p>In this type of financing, the company gets an amount that is a reduced value of the total receivables owed by customers. The time-frame of the receivables exert a large influence on the amount of financing. For older receivables, the company will get less financing. It is also, sometimes, referred to as <b>"factoring"</b>.</p>
<h3>Letters of Credit</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Letters of Credit are one of the oldest methods of trade financing.</p>
<h3>Banker’s Acceptance</h3>
<p>A banker’s acceptance (BA) is a short-term debt instrument that is issued by a firm that guarantees payment by a commercial bank. BAs are used by firms as a part of the commercial transaction. These instruments are like <b>T-Bills</b> and are often used in case of money market funds.</p>
<p>BAs are also traded at a discount from the actual face value on the secondary market. This is an advantage because the BA is not required to be held until maturity. BAs are regular instruments that are used in international trade.</p>
<h3>Working Capital Finance</h3>
<p>Working capital finance is a process termed as the capital of a business and is used in its daily trading operations. It is calculated as the current assets minus the current liabilities. For many firms, this is fully made up of trade debtors (bills outstanding) and the trade creditors (the bills the firm needs to pay).</p>
<h3>Forfaiting</h3>
<p>Forfaiting is the purchase of the amount importers owe the exporter at a discounted value by paying cash. The forfaiter that is the buyer of the receivables then becomes the party the importer is obligated to pay the debt.</p>
<h3>Countertrade</h3>
<p>It is a form of international trade where goods are exchanged for other goods, in place of hard currency. Countertrade is classified into three major categories – barter, counter-purchase, and offset.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Barter</b> is the oldest countertrade process. It involves the direct receipt and offer of goods and services having an equivalent value.</p></li>
<li><p>In a <b>counter-purchase,</b> the foreign seller contractually accepts to buy the goods or services obtained from the buyer's nation for a defined amount.</p></li>
<li><p>In an <b>offset</b> arrangement, the seller assists in marketing the products manufactured in the buying country. It may also allow a portion of the assembly of the exported products for the manufacturers to carry out in the buying country. This is often practiced in the aerospace and defense industries.</p></li>
