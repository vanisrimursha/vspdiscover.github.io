<h1>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms - Overview</h1>

<p>Data Structure is a systematic way to organize data in order to use it efficiently. Following terms are the foundation terms of a data structure.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Interface</b> &minus; Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents the set of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Implementation</b> &minus; Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Characteristics of a Data Structure</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Correctness</b> &minus; Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Time Complexity</b> &minus; Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Space Complexity</b> &minus; Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Need for Data Structure</h2>
<p>As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now-a-days.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Data Search</b> &minus; Consider an inventory of 1 million(10<sup>6</sup>) items of a store. If the application is to search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million(10<sup>6</sup>) items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, search will become slower.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Processor speed</b> &minus; Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Multiple requests</b> &minus; As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To solve the above-mentioned problems, data structures come to rescue. Data can be organized in a data structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be searched almost instantly.</p>
<h2>Execution Time Cases</h2>
<p>There are three cases which are usually used to compare various data structure's execution time in a relative manner.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Worst Case</b> &minus; This is the scenario where a particular data structure operation takes maximum time it can take. If an operation's worst case time is &#402;(n) then this operation will not take more than &#402;(n) time where &#402;(n) represents function of n.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Average Case</b> &minus; This is the scenario depicting the average execution time of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes &#402;(n) time in execution, then m operations will take m&#402;(n) time.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Best Case</b> &minus; This is the scenario depicting the least possible execution time of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes &#402;(n) time in execution, then the actual operation may take time as the random number which would be maximum as &#402;(n).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Terminology</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Data</b> &minus; Data are values or set of values.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>Data Item</b> &minus; Data item refers to single unit of values.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Group Items</b> &minus; Data items that are divided into sub items are called as Group Items.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Elementary Items</b> &minus; Data items that cannot be divided are called as Elementary Items.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Attribute and Entity</b> &minus; An entity is that which contains certain attributes or properties, which may be assigned values.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Entity Set</b> &minus; Entities of similar attributes form an entity set.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Field</b> &minus; Field is a single elementary unit of information representing an attribute of an entity.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Record</b> &minus; Record is a collection of field values of a given entity.</p></li>
<li><p><b>File</b> &minus; File is a collection of records of the entities in a given entity set.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Data Structures - Algorithms Basics</h1>

<p>Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.</p>
<p>From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Search</b> &minus; Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sort</b> &minus; Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Insert</b> &minus; Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Update</b> &minus;  Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Delete</b> &minus; Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Characteristics of an Algorithm</h2>
<p>Not all procedures can be called an algorithm. An algorithm should have the following characteristics &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Unambiguous</b> &minus; Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and their inputs/outputs should be clear and must lead to only one meaning.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Input</b> &minus; An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Output</b> &minus; An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Finiteness</b> &minus; Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Feasibility</b> &minus; Should be feasible with the available resources.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Independent</b> &minus; An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Write an Algorithm?</h2>
<p>There are no well-defined standards for writing algorithms. Rather, it is problem and resource dependent. Algorithms are never written to support a particular programming code.</p>
<p>As we know that all programming languages share basic code constructs like loops (do, for, while), flow-control (if-else), etc. These common constructs can be used to write an algorithm.</p>
<p>We write algorithms in a step-by-step manner, but it is not always the case. Algorithm writing is a process and is executed after the problem domain is well-defined. That is, we should know the problem domain, for which we are designing a solution.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let's try to learn algorithm-writing by using an example.</p>
<p><b>Problem</b> &minus; Design an algorithm to add two numbers and display the result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
<b>step 1</b> &minus; START
<b>step 2</b> &minus; declare three integers <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> &amp; <b>c</b>
<b>step 3</b> &minus; define values of <b>a</b> &amp; <b>b</b>
<b>step 4</b> &minus; add values of <b>a</b> &amp; <b>b</b>
<b>step 5</b> &minus; store output of <u>step 4</u> to <b>c</b>
<b>step 6</b> &minus; print <b>c</b>
<b>step 7</b> &minus; STOP
</pre>
<p>Algorithms tell the programmers how to code the program. Alternatively, the algorithm can be written as &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
<b>step 1</b> &minus; START ADD
<b>step 2</b> &minus; get values of <b>a</b> &amp; <b>b</b>
<b>step 3</b> &minus; c &larr; a &plus; b
<b>step 4</b> &minus; display c
<b>step 5</b> &minus; STOP
</pre>
<p>In design and analysis of algorithms, usually the second method is used to describe an algorithm. It makes it easy for the analyst to analyze the algorithm ignoring all unwanted definitions. He can observe what operations are being used and how the process is flowing.</p>
<p>Writing <b>step numbers</b>, is optional.</p>
<p>We design an algorithm to get a solution of a given problem. A problem can be solved in more than one ways.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/problem_solutions.jpg" alt="one problem many solutions" />
<p>Hence, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. The next step is to analyze those proposed solution algorithms and implement the best suitable solution.</p>
<h2>Algorithm Analysis</h2>
<p>Efficiency of an algorithm can be analyzed at two different stages, before implementation and after implementation. They are the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>A Priori Analysis</b> &minus; This is a theoretical analysis of an algorithm. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by assuming that all other factors, for example, processor speed, are constant and have no effect on the implementation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>A Posterior Analysis</b> &minus; This is an empirical analysis of an algorithm. The selected algorithm is implemented using programming language. This is then executed on target computer machine. In this analysis, actual statistics like running time and space required, are collected.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We shall learn about a priori algorithm analysis. Algorithm analysis deals with the execution or running time of various operations involved. The running time of an operation can be defined as the number of computer instructions executed per operation.</p>
<h2>Algorithm Complexity</h2>
<p>Suppose <b>X</b> is an algorithm and <b>n</b> is the size of input data, the time and space used by the algorithm X are the two main factors, which decide the efficiency of X.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Time Factor</b> &minus; Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisons in the sorting algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Space Factor</b> &minus; Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The complexity of an algorithm <b>f(n)</b> gives the running time and/or the storage space required by the algorithm in terms of <b>n</b> as the size of input data.</p>
<h2>Space Complexity</h2>
<p>Space complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of memory space required by the algorithm in its life cycle. The space required by an algorithm is equal to the sum of the following two components &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A fixed part that is a space required to store certain data and variables, that are independent of the size of the problem. For example, simple variables and constants used, program size, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>A variable part is a space required by variables, whose size depends on the size of the problem. For example, dynamic memory allocation, recursion stack space, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Space complexity S(P) of any algorithm P is S(P) = C &plus; SP(I), where C is the fixed part and S(I) is the variable part of the algorithm, which depends on instance characteristic I. Following is a simple example that tries to explain the concept &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Algorithm: SUM(A, B)
Step 1 -  START
Step 2 -  C &larr; A &plus; B &plus; 10
Step 3 -  Stop
</pre>
<p>Here we have three variables A, B, and C and one constant. Hence S(P) = 1 &plus; 3. Now, space depends on data types of given variables and constant types and it will be multiplied accordingly.</p>
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
<p>Time complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of time required by the algorithm to run to completion. Time requirements can be defined as a numerical function T(n), where T(n) can be measured as the number of steps, provided each step consumes constant time.</p>
<p>For example, addition of two n-bit integers takes <b>n</b> steps. Consequently, the total computational time is T(n) = c &lowast; n, where c is the time taken for the addition of two bits. Here, we observe that T(n) grows linearly as the input size increases.</p>

<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms - Arrays</h1>

<p>Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type. Most of the data structures make use of arrays to implement their algorithms. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Array.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Element</b> &minus; Each item stored in an array is called an element.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Index</b> &minus; Each location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the element.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Array Representation</h2>
<p>Arrays can be declared in various ways in different languages. For illustration, let's take C array declaration.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/array_representation.jpg" alt="Array Representation" /> 
<p>As per the above illustration, following are the important points to be considered.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Index starts with 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Array length is 10 which means it can store 10 elements.</p></li>
<li><p>Each element can be accessed via its index. For example, we can fetch an element at index 6 as 9.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Operations</h2>
<p>Following are the basic operations supported by an array.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Traverse</b> &minus; print all the array elements one by one.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Insertion</b> &minus; Adds an element at the given index.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Deletion</b> &minus; Deletes an element at the given index.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Search</b> &minus; Searches an element using the given index or by the value.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Update</b> &minus; Updates an element at the given index.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In C, when an array is initialized with size, then it assigns defaults values to its elements in following order.</p>
<table style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Data Type</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Default Value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bool</td>
<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>char</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>int</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>float</td>
<td>0.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>double</td>
<td>0.0f</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>void</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>wchar_t</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Insertion Operation</h2>
<p>Insert operation is to insert one or more data elements into an array. Based on the requirement, a new element can be added at the beginning, end, or any given index of array.</p>
<p>Here, we see a practical implementation of insertion operation, where we add data at the end of the array &minus;</p>

<li><p><b>Delete</b> &minus; Deletes an element using the given key.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Insertion Operation</h2>
<p>Adding a new node in linked list is a more than one step activity. We shall learn this with diagrams here. First, create a node using the same structure and find the location where it has to be inserted.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_insertion_0.jpg" alt="Linked List Insertion" /> 
<p>Imagine that we are inserting a node <b>B</b> (NewNode), between <b>A</b> (LeftNode) and <b>C</b> (RightNode). Then point B.next to C &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
NewNode.next -&gt; RightNode;
</pre>
<p>It should look like this &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_insertion_1.jpg" alt="Linked List Insertion" /> 
<p>Now, the next node at the left should point to the new node.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
LeftNode.next -&gt; NewNode;
</pre>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_insertion_2.jpg" alt="Linked List Insertion" /> 
<p>This will put the new node in the middle of the two. The new list should look like this &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_insertion_3.jpg" alt="Linked List Insertion" /> 
<p>Similar steps should be taken if the node is being inserted at the beginning of the list. While inserting it at the end, the second last node of the list should point to the new node and the new node will point to NULL.</p>
<h2>Deletion Operation</h2>
<p>Deletion is also a more than one step process. We shall learn with pictorial representation. First, locate the target node to be removed, by using searching algorithms.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_deletion_0.jpg" alt="Linked List Deletion" /> 
<p>The left (previous) node of the target node now should point to the next node of the target node &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
LeftNode.next -&gt; TargetNode.next;
</pre>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_deletion_1.jpg" alt="Linked List Deletion" /> 
<p>This will remove the link that was pointing to the target node. Now, using the following code, we will remove what the target node is pointing at.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
TargetNode.next -&gt; NULL;
</pre>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_deletion_2.jpg" alt="Linked List Deletion" /> 
<p>We need to use the deleted node. We can keep that in memory otherwise we can simply deallocate memory and wipe off the target node completely.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_deletion_3.jpg" alt="Linked List Deletion" /> 
<h2>Reverse Operation</h2>
<p>This operation is a thorough one. We need to make the last node to be pointed by the head node and reverse the whole linked list.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_reverse_0.jpg" alt="Linked List Reverse Operation" /> 
<p>First, we traverse to the end of the list. It should be pointing to NULL. Now, we shall make it point to its previous node &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_reverse_1.jpg" alt="Linked List Reverse Operation" />
<p>We have to make sure that the last node is not the lost node. So we'll have some temp node, which looks like the head node pointing to the last node. Now, we shall make all left side nodes point to their previous nodes one by one.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_reverse_2.jpg" alt="Linked List Reverse Operation" /> 
<p>Except the node (first node) pointed by the head node, all nodes should point to their predecessor, making them their new successor. The first node will point to NULL.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_reverse_3.jpg" alt="Linked List Reverse Operation" /> 
<p>We'll make the head node point to the new first node by using the temp node.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/linked_list_reverse_4.jpg" alt="Linked List Reverse Operation" />

<h1>Data Structure - Doubly Linked List</h1>

<p>Doubly Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which navigation is possible in both ways, either forward and backward easily as compared to Single Linked List. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of doubly linked list.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Link</b> &minus; Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Next</b> &minus; Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Prev</b> &minus; Each link of a linked list contains a link to the previous link called Prev.</p></li>
<li><p><b>LinkedList</b> &minus; A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First and to the last link called Last.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Doubly Linked List Representation</h2>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/doubly_linked_list.jpg" alt="Doubly Linked List" /> 
<p>As per the above illustration, following are the important points to be considered.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Doubly Linked List contains a link element called first and last.</p></li>
<li><p>Each link carries a data field(s) and two link fields called next and prev.</p></li>
<li><p>Each link is linked with its next link using its next link.</p></li>
<li><p>Each link is linked with its previous link using its previous link.</p></li>
<li><p>The last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Operations</h2>
<p>Following are the basic operations supported by a list.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Insertion Operation</h2>   
<p>Following code demonstrates the insertion operation at the beginning of a doubly linked list.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

   //point first to new first link
   head = link;
}
</pre>
<h2>Deletion Operation</h2>

<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms - Stack</h1>

<p>A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example – a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/stack_example.jpg" alt="Stack Example" />
<p>A real-world stack allows operations at one end only. For example, we can place or remove a card or plate from the top of the stack only. Likewise, Stack ADT allows all data operations at one end only. At any given time, we can only access the top element of a stack.</p>
<p>This feature makes it LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out. Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first. In stack terminology, insertion operation is called <b>PUSH</b> operation and removal operation is called <b>POP</b> operation.</p>
<h2>Stack Representation</h2>
<p>The following diagram depicts a stack and its operations &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/stack_representation.jpg" alt="Stack Representation" />
<p>A stack can be implemented by means of Array, Structure, Pointer, and Linked List. Stack can either be a fixed size one or it may have a sense of dynamic resizing. Here, we are going to implement stack using arrays, which makes it a fixed size stack implementation.</p>
<h2>Basic Operations</h2>
<p>Stack operations may involve initializing the stack, using it and then de-initializing it. Apart from these basic stuffs, a stack is used for the following two primary operations &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>push()</b> &minus; Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.</p></li>
<li><p><b>pop()</b> &minus; Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When data is PUSHed onto stack.</p>
<p>To use a stack efficiently, we need to check the status of stack as well. For the same purpose, the following functionality is added to stacks &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>peek()</b> &minus; get the top data element of the stack, without removing it.</p></li>
<li><p><b>isFull()</b> &minus; check if stack is full.</p></li>
<li><p><b>isEmpty()</b> &minus; check if stack is empty.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At all times, we maintain a pointer to the last PUSHed data on the stack. As this pointer always represents the top of the stack, hence named <b>top</b>. The <b>top</b> pointer provides top value of the stack without actually removing it.</p>
<p>First we should learn about procedures to support stack functions &minus;</p>
<h3>peek()</h3>
<p>Algorithm of peek() function &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
begin procedure peek

   return stack[top]
   
end procedure
</pre>
<p>Implementation of peek() function in C programming language &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="peek">
int peek() {
   return stack[top];
}
</pre>
<h3>isfull()</h3>
<p>Algorithm of isfull() function &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
begin procedure isfull

   if top equals to MAXSIZE
      return true
   else
      return false
   endif
   
end procedure
</pre>
<p>Implementation of isfull() function in C programming language &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="isfull">
bool isfull() {
   if(top == MAXSIZE)
      return true;
   else
      return false;
}
</pre>
<h3>isempty()</h3>
<p>Algorithm of isempty() function &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
begin procedure isempty

   if top less than 1
      return true
   else
      return false
   endif
   
end procedure
</pre>
<p>Implementation of isempty() function in C programming language is slightly different. We initialize top at -1, as the index in array starts from 0. So we check if the top is below zero or -1 to determine if the stack is empty. Here's the code &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="isempty">
bool isempty() {
   if(top == -1)
      return true;
   else
      return false;
}
</pre>
<h2>Push Operation</h2>
<p>The process of putting a new data element onto stack is known as a Push Operation. Push operation involves a series of steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Checks if the stack is full.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; If the stack is full, produces an error and exit.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; If the stack is not full, increments <b>top</b> to point next empty space.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Adds data element to the stack location, where top is pointing.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Returns success.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/stack_push_operation.jpg" alt="Stack Push Operation" />
<p>If the linked list is used to implement the stack, then in step 3, we need to allocate space dynamically.</p>
<h3>Algorithm for PUSH Operation</h3>
<p>A simple algorithm for Push operation can be derived as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
begin procedure push: stack, data

   if stack is full
      return null
   endif
   
   top &larr; top + 1
   
   stack[top] &larr; data

end procedure
</pre>
<p>Implementation of this algorithm in C, is very easy. See the following code &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="push">
void push(int data) {
   if(!isFull()) {
      top = top &plus; 1;   
      stack[top] = data;
   } else {
      printf("Could not insert data, Stack is full.\n");
   }
}
</pre>
<h2>Pop Operation</h2>
<p>Accessing the content while removing it from the stack, is known as a Pop Operation. In an array implementation of pop() operation, the data element is not actually removed, instead <b>top</b> is decremented to a lower position in the stack to point to the next value. But in linked-list implementation, pop() actually removes data element and deallocates memory space.</p>
<p>A Pop operation may involve the following steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Checks if the stack is empty.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; If the stack is empty, produces an error and exit.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; If the stack is not empty, accesses the data element at which <b>top</b> is pointing.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Decreases the value of top by 1.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Returns success.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/stack_pop_operation.jpg" alt="Stack Pop Operation" />
<h3>Algorithm for Pop Operation</h3>
<p>A simple algorithm for Pop operation can be derived as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
begin procedure pop: stack

   if stack is empty
      return null
   endif
   
   data &larr; stack[top]
   
   top &larr; top - 1
   
   return data

end procedure
</pre>
<p>Implementation of this algorithm in C, is as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="pop">
int pop(int data) {

   if(!isempty()) {
      data = stack[top];
      top = top - 1;   
      return data;
   } else {
      printf("Could not retrieve data, Stack is empty.\n");
   }
}
</pre>
<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms - Queue</h1>

<p>Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/queue_example.jpg" alt="Queue Example" />
<p>A real-world example of queue can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle enters first, exits first. More real-world examples can be seen as queues at the ticket windows and bus-stops.</p>
<h2>Queue Representation</h2>
<p>As we now understand that in queue, we access both ends for different reasons. The following diagram given below tries to explain queue representation as data structure &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/queue_diagram.jpg" alt="Queue Example" />
<p>As in stacks, a queue can also be implemented using Arrays, Linked-lists, Pointers and Structures. For the sake of simplicity, we shall implement queues using one-dimensional array.</p>
<h2>Basic Operations</h2>
<p>Queue operations may involve initializing or defining the queue, utilizing it, and then completely erasing it from the memory. Here we shall try to understand the basic operations associated with queues &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>enqueue()</b> &minus; add (store) an item to the queue.</p></li>
<li><p><b>dequeue()</b> &minus; remove (access) an item from the queue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Few more functions are required to make the above-mentioned queue operation efficient. These are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>peek()</b> &minus; Gets the element at the front of the queue without removing it.</p></li>
<li><p><b>isfull()</b> &minus; Checks if the queue is full.</p></li>
<li><p><b>isempty()</b> &minus; Checks if the queue is empty.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In queue, we always dequeue (or access) data, pointed by <b>front</b> pointer and while enqueing (or storing) data in the queue we take help of <b>rear</b> pointer.</p>
<p>Let's first learn about supportive functions of a queue &minus;</p>
<h3>peek()</h3>
<p>This function helps to see the data at the <b>front</b> of the queue. The algorithm of peek() function is as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>Algorithm</b></p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
begin procedure peek

   return queue[front]
   
end procedure
</pre>
<p>Implementation of peek() function in C programming language &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="peek">
int peek() {
   return queue[front];
}
</pre>
<h3>isfull()</h3>
<p>As we are using single dimension array to implement queue, we just check for the rear pointer to reach at MAXSIZE to determine that the queue is full. In case we maintain the queue in a circular linked-list, the algorithm will differ. Algorithm of isfull() function &minus;</p>
<p><b>Algorithm</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
begin procedure isfull

   if rear equals to MAXSIZE
      return true
   else
      return false
   endif
   
end procedure
</pre>
<p>Implementation of isfull() function in C programming language &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
bool isfull() {
   if(rear == MAXSIZE - 1)
      return true;
   else
      return false;
}
</pre>
<h3>isempty()</h3>
<p>Algorithm of isempty() function &minus;</p>
<p><b>Algorithm</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
begin procedure isempty

   if front is less than MIN  OR front is greater than rear
      return true
   else
      return false
   endif
   
end procedure
</pre>
<p>If the value of <b>front</b> is less than MIN or 0, it tells that the queue is not yet initialized, hence empty.</p>
<p>Here's the C programming code &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
bool isempty() {
   if(front &lt; 0 || front &gt; rear) 
      return true;
   else
      return false;
}
</pre>
<h2>Enqueue Operation</h2>
<p>Queues maintain two data pointers, <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b>. Therefore, its operations are comparatively difficult to implement than that of stacks.</p>
<p>The following steps should be taken to enqueue (insert) data into a queue &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Check if the queue is full.</p></li>   
<li><p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; If the queue is full, produce overflow error and exit.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; If the queue is not full, increment <b>rear</b> pointer to point the next empty space.</p></li>   
<li><p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Add data element to the queue location, where the rear is pointing.</p></li>   
<li><p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; return success.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/queue_enqueue_diagram.jpg" alt="Insert Operation" />
<p>Sometimes, we also check to see if a queue is initialized or not, to handle any unforeseen situations.</p>
<p><b>Algorithm for enqueue operation</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
procedure enqueue(data)      
   if queue is full
      return overflow
   endif
   
   rear &larr; rear + 1
   
   queue[rear] &larr; data
   
   return true
   
end procedure
</pre>
<p>Implementation of enqueue() in C programming language &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
int enqueue(int data)      
   if(isfull())
      return 0;
   
   rear = rear &plus; 1;
   queue[rear] = data;
   
   return 1;
end procedure
</pre>
<h2>Dequeue Operation</h2>
<p>Accessing data from the queue is a process of two tasks - access the data where <b>front</b> is pointing and remove the data after access. The following steps are taken to perform <b>dequeue</b> operation &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Check if the queue is empty.</p></li>   
<li><p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; If the queue is empty, produce underflow error and exit.</p></li>   
<li><p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; If the queue is not empty, access the data where <b>front</b> is pointing.</p></li>   
<li><p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Increment <b>front</b> pointer to point to the next available data element.</p></li>   
<li><p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Return success.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/queue_dequeue_diagram.jpg" alt="Remove Operation" />
<p><b>Algorithm for dequeue operation</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
procedure dequeue

<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms Linear Search</h1>

<p>Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.</p>

<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms Binary Search</h1>
<p>Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of &Omicron;(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.</p>
<p>Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.</p>
<h2>How Binary Search Works?</h2>
<p>For a binary search to work, it is mandatory for the target array to be sorted. We shall learn the process of binary search with a pictorial example. The following is our sorted array and let us assume that we need to search the location of value 31 using binary search.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/binary_search_0.jpg" alt="Binary search" /> 
<p>First, we shall determine half of the array by using this formula &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
mid = low &plus; (high - low) / 2
</pre>
<p>Here it is, 0 &plus; (9 - 0 ) / 2 = 4 (integer value of 4.5). So, 4 is the mid of the array.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/binary_search_1.jpg" alt="Binary search" /> 
<p>Now we compare the value stored at location 4, with the value being searched, i.e. 31. We find that the value at location 4 is 27, which is not a match. As the value is greater than 27 and we have a sorted array, so we also know that the target value must be in the upper portion of the array.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/binary_search_2.jpg" alt="Binary search" /> 
<p>We change our low to mid &plus; 1 and find the new mid value again.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
low = mid &plus; 1
mid = low &plus; (high - low) / 2
</pre>
<p>Our new mid is 7 now. We compare the value stored at location 7 with our target value 31.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/binary_search_3.jpg" alt="Binary search" /> 
<p>The value stored at location 7 is not a match, rather it is more than what we are looking for. So, the value must be in the lower part from this location.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/binary_search_4.jpg" alt="Binary search" /> 
<p>Hence, we calculate the mid again. This time it is 5.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/binary_search_5.jpg" alt="Binary search" /> 
<p>We compare the value stored at location 5 with our target value. We find that it is a match.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/binary_search_6.jpg" alt="Binary search" /> 
<p>We conclude that the target value 31 is stored at location 5.</p>
<p>Binary search halves the searchable items and thus reduces the count of comparisons to be made to very less numbers.</p>

<h1>Data Structure - Sorting Techniques</h1>

<p>Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order.</p>
<p>The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, if data is stored in a sorted manner. Sorting is also used to represent data in more readable formats. Following are some of the examples of sorting in real-life scenarios &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Telephone Directory</b> &minus; The telephone directory stores the telephone numbers of people sorted by their names, so that the names can be searched easily.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Dictionary</b> &minus; The dictionary stores words in an alphabetical order so that searching of any word becomes easy.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>In-place Sorting and Not-in-place Sorting</h2>
<p>Sorting algorithms may require some extra space for comparison and temporary storage of few data elements. These algorithms do not require any extra space and sorting is said to happen in-place, or for example, within the array itself. This is called <b>in-place sorting</b>. Bubble sort is an example of in-place sorting.</p>
<p>However, in some sorting algorithms, the program requires space which is more than or equal to the elements being sorted. Sorting which uses equal or more space is called <b>not-in-place sorting</b>. Merge-sort is an example of not-in-place sorting.</p>
<h2>Stable and Not Stable Sorting</h2>
<p>If a sorting algorithm, after sorting the contents, does not change the sequence of similar content in which they appear, it is called <b>stable sorting</b>.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/stable_sort.jpg" alt="Stable Sorting" />
<p>If a sorting algorithm, after sorting the contents, changes the sequence of similar content in which they appear, it is called <b>unstable sorting</b>.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/unstable_sort.jpg" alt="Unstable Sorting" />
<p>Stability of an algorithm matters when we wish to maintain the sequence of original elements, like in a tuple for example.</p>
<h2>Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Sorting Algorithm</h2>
<p>A sorting algorithm is said to be adaptive, if it takes advantage of already 'sorted' elements in the list that is to be sorted. That is, while sorting if the source list has some element already sorted, adaptive algorithms will take this into account and will try not to re-order them.</p>
<p>A non-adaptive algorithm is one which does not take into account the elements which are already sorted. They try to force every single element to be re-ordered to confirm their sortedness.</p>
<h2>Important Terms</h2>   
<p>Some terms are generally coined while discussing sorting techniques, here is a brief introduction to them &minus;</p>
<h3>Increasing Order</h3>
<p>A sequence of values is said to be in <b>increasing order</b>, if the successive element is greater than the previous one. For example, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 are in increasing order, as every next element is greater than the previous element.</p>
<h3>Decreasing Order</h3>
<p>A sequence of values is said to be in <b>decreasing order</b>, if the successive element is less than the current one. For example, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3, 1 are in decreasing order, as every next element is less than the previous element.</p>
<h3>Non-Increasing Order</h3>
<p>A sequence of values is said to be in <b>non-increasing order</b>, if the successive element is less than or equal to its previous element in the sequence. This order occurs when the sequence contains duplicate values. For example, 9, 8, 6, 3, 3, 1 are in non-increasing order, as every next element is less than or equal to (in case of 3) but not greater than any previous element.</p>
<h3>Non-Decreasing Order</h3>
<p>A sequence of values is said to be in <b>non-decreasing order</b>, if the successive element is greater than or equal to its previous element in the sequence. This order occurs when the sequence contains duplicate values. For example, 1, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9 are in non-decreasing order, as every next element is greater than or equal to (in case of 3) but not less than the previous one.</p>

<h1>Data Structure - Bubble Sort Algorithm</h1>

<p>Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of &Omicron;(n<sup>2</sup>) where <b>n</b> is the number of items.</p>
<h2>How Bubble Sort Works?</h2>
<p>We take an unsorted array for our example. Bubble sort takes &Omicron;(n<sup>2</sup>) time so we're keeping it short and precise.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_0.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>Bubble sort starts with very first two elements, comparing them to check which one is greater.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_1.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>In this case, value 33 is greater than 14, so it is already in sorted locations. Next, we compare 33 with 27.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_2.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>We find that 27 is smaller than 33 and these two values must be swapped.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_3.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>The new array should look like this &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_4.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>Next we compare 33 and 35. We find that both are in already sorted positions.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_5.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>Then we move to the next two values, 35 and 10.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_6.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>We know then that 10 is smaller 35. Hence they are not sorted.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_7.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>We swap these values. We find that we have reached the end of the array. After one iteration, the array should look like this &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_8.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>To be precise, we are now showing how an array should look like after each iteration. After the second iteration, it should look like this &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_9.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>Notice that after each iteration, at least one value moves at the end.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_10.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>And when there's no swap required, bubble sorts learns that an array is completely sorted.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/bubble_sort_11.jpg" alt="Bubble Sort" />  
<p>Now we should look into some practical aspects of bubble sort.</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p>We assume <b>list</b> is an array of <b>n</b> elements. We further assume that <b>swap</b> function swaps the values of the given array elements.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
begin BubbleSort(list)

   for all elements of list
      if list[i] &gt; list[i+1]
         swap(list[i], list[i+1])
      end if
   end for
   
   return list
   
end BubbleSort
</pre> 
<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
<p>We observe in algorithm that Bubble Sort compares each pair of array element unless the whole array is completely sorted in an ascending order. This may cause a few complexity issues like what if the array needs no more swapping as all the elements are already ascending.</p>
<p>To ease-out the issue, we use one flag variable <b>swapped</b> which will help us see if any swap has happened or not. If no swap has occurred, i.e. the array requires no more processing to be sorted, it will come out of the loop.</p>
<p>Pseudocode of BubbleSort algorithm can be written as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
procedure bubbleSort( list : array of items )

   loop = list.count;
   
   for i = 0 to loop-1 do:
      swapped = false
		
      for j = 0 to loop-1 do:
      
         /* compare the adjacent elements */   
         if list[j] &gt; list[j+1] then
            /* swap them */
            swap( list[j], list[j+1] )		 
            swapped = true
         end if
         
      end for
      
      /*if no number was swapped that means 
      array is sorted now, break the loop.*/
      
      if(not swapped) then
         break
      end if
      
   end for
   
end procedure return list
</pre> 
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>One more issue we did not address in our original algorithm and its improvised pseudocode, is that, after every iteration the highest values settles down at the end of the array. Hence, the next iteration need not include already sorted elements. For this purpose, in our implementation, we restrict the inner loop to avoid already sorted values.</p>
<hr />



<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms Insertion Sort</h1>

<p>This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted. For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted. An element which is to be 'insert'ed in this sorted sub-list, has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there. Hence the name, <b>insertion sort</b>.</p>
<p>The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of &Omicron;(n<sup>2</sup>), where <b>n</b> is the number of items.</p>
<h2>How Insertion Sort Works?</h2>
<p>We take an unsorted array for our example.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/unsorted_array.jpg" alt="Unsorted Array" />  
<p>Insertion sort compares the first two elements.</p>
<p>It finds that both 14 and 33 are already in ascending order. For now, 14 is in sorted sub-list.</p>
<p>Insertion sort moves ahead and compares 33 with 27.</p>
<p>And finds that 33 is not in the correct position.</p>
<p>It swaps 33 with 27. It also checks with all the elements of sorted sub-list. Here we see that the sorted sub-list has only one element 14, and 27 is greater than 14. Hence, the sorted sub-list remains sorted after swapping.</p>
<p>By now we have 14 and 27 in the sorted sub-list. Next, it compares 33 with 10.</p>
<p>These values are not in a sorted order.</p>
<p>So we swap them.</p>
<p>However, swapping makes 27 and 10 unsorted.</p>
<p>Hence, we swap them too.</p>
<p>Again we find 14 and 10 in an unsorted order.</p>
<p>We swap them again. By the end of third iteration, we have a sorted sub-list of 4 items.</p>
<p>This process goes on until all the unsorted values are covered in a sorted sub-list. Now we shall see some programming aspects of insertion sort.</p>   
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<p>Now we have a bigger picture of how this sorting technique works, so we can derive simple steps by which we can achieve insertion sort.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
<b>Step 1</b> &minus; If it is the first element, it is already sorted. return 1;
<b>Step 2</b> &minus; Pick next element
<b>Step 3</b> &minus; Compare with all elements in the sorted sub-list
<b>Step 4</b> &minus; Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-list that is greater than the 
         value to be sorted
<b>Step 5</b> &minus; Insert the value
<b>Step 6</b> &minus; Repeat until list is sorted
</pre>    
<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
procedure insertionSort( A : array of items )
   int holePosition
   int valueToInsert
	
   for i = 1 to length(A) inclusive do:
	
      /* select value to be inserted */
      valueToInsert = A[i]
      holePosition = i
      
      /*locate hole position for the element to be inserted */
		
      while holePosition &gt; 0 and A[holePosition-1] &gt; valueToInsert do:
         A[holePosition] = A[holePosition-1]
         holePosition = holePosition -1
      end while
		
      /* insert the number at hole position */
      A[holePosition] = valueToInsert
      
   end for
	
end procedure

<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms Selection Sort</h1>

<p>Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.</p>
<p>The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.</p>
<p>This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities are of &Omicron;(n<sup>2</sup>), where <b>n</b> is the number of items.</p>
<h2>How Selection Sort Works?</h2>
<p>Consider the following depicted array as an example.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/unsorted_array.jpg" alt="Unsorted Array" />  
<p>For the first position in the sorted list, the whole list is scanned sequentially. The first position where 14 is stored presently, we search the whole list and find that 10 is the lowest value.</p>
<p>So we replace 14 with 10. After one iteration 10, which happens to be the minimum value in the list, appears in the first position of the sorted list.</p>
<p>For the second position, where 33 is residing, we start scanning the rest of the list in a linear manner.</p>
<p>We find that 14 is the second lowest value in the list and it should appear at the second place. We swap these values.</p>
<p>After two iterations, two least values are positioned at the beginning in a sorted manner.</p>
<p>The same process is applied to the rest of the items in the array.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/selection_sort.jpg" alt="Selection Sort" />  
<p>Now, let us learn some programming aspects of selection sort.</p>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
<b>Step 1</b> &minus; Set MIN to location 0
<b>Step 2</b> &minus; Search the minimum element in the list
<b>Step 3</b> &minus; Swap with value at location MIN
<b>Step 4</b> &minus; Increment MIN to point to next element
<b>Step 5</b> &minus; Repeat until list is sorted
</pre>    
<h3>Pseudocode</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
procedure selection sort 
   list  : array of items
   n     : size of list

   for i = 1 to n - 1
   /* set current element as minimum*/
      min = i    
  
      /* check the element to be minimum */

      for j = i&plus;1 to n 
         if list[j] &lt; list[min] then
            min = j;
         end if
      end for

      /* swap the minimum element with the current element*/
      if indexMin != i  then
         swap list[min] and list[i]
      end if

   end for
	
end procedure
</pre> 



<h1>Data Structures - Merge Sort Algorithm</h1>
<p>Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being &Omicron;(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.</p>
<p>Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.</p>
<h2>How Merge Sort Works?</h2>
<p>To understand merge sort, we take an unsorted array as the following &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/unsorted_array.jpg" alt="Unsorted Array" />  
<p>We know that merge sort first divides the whole array iteratively into equal halves unless the atomic values are achieved. We see here that an array of 8 items is divided into two arrays of size 4.</p>
<p>This does not change the sequence of appearance of items in the original. Now we divide these two arrays into halves.</p>
<p>We further divide these arrays and we achieve atomic value which can no more be divided.</p>
<p>Now, we combine them in exactly the same manner as they were broken down. Please note the color codes given to these lists.</p>
<p>We first compare the element for each list and then combine them into another list in a sorted manner. We see that 14 and 33 are in sorted positions. We compare 27 and 10 and in the target list of 2 values we put 10 first, followed by 27. We change the order of 19 and 35 whereas 42 and 44 are placed sequentially.</p>
<p>In the next iteration of the combining phase, we compare lists of two data values, and merge them into a list of found data values placing all in a sorted order.</p>
<p>After the final merging, the list should look like this &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/merge_sort.jpg" alt="Merge Sort" />  
<p>Now we should learn some programming aspects of merge sorting.</p>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<p>Merge sort keeps on dividing the list into equal halves until it can no more be divided. By definition, if it is only one element in the list, it is sorted. Then, merge sort combines the smaller sorted lists keeping the new list sorted too.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
<b>Step 1</b> &minus; if it is only one element in the list it is already sorted, return.
<b>Step 2</b> &minus; divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.
<b>Step 3</b> &minus; merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.
</pre>
<h3>Pseudocode</h3>
<p>We shall now see the pseudocodes for merge sort functions. As our algorithms point out two main functions - divide &amp; merge.</p>
<p>Merge sort works with recursion and we shall see our implementation in the same way.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
procedure mergesort( var a as array )
   if ( n == 1 ) return a

   var l1 as array = a[0] ... a[n/2]
   var l2 as array = a[n/2+1] ... a[n]

   l1 = mergesort( l1 )
   l2 = mergesort( l2 )

   return merge( l1, l2 )
end procedure

procedure merge( var a as array, var b as array )

   var c as array

   while ( a and b have elements )
      if ( a[0] &gt; b[0] )
         add b[0] to the end of c
         remove b[0] from b
      else
         add a[0] to the end of c
         remove a[0] from a
      end if
   end while
   
   while ( a has elements )
      add a[0] to the end of c
      remove a[0] from a
   end while
   
   while ( b has elements )

<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms - Quick Sort</h1>
<p>Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.</p> 
<p>Quick sort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the two resulting subarrays. This algorithm is quite efficient for large-sized data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of &Omicron;(n<sup>2</sup>), where <b>n</b> is the number of items.</p>
<h2>Partition in Quick Sort</h2>
<p>Following animated representation explains how to find the pivot value in an array.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/quick_sort_partition_animation.gif" alt="Quick Sort Partition Animation" />
<p>The pivot value divides the list into two parts. And recursively, we find the pivot for each sub-lists until all lists contains only one element.</p>
<h2>Quick Sort Pivot Algorithm</h2>
<p>Based on our understanding of partitioning in quick sort, we will now try to write an algorithm for it, which is as follows.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
<b>Step 1</b> &minus; Choose the highest index value has pivot
<b>Step 2</b> &minus; Take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding pivot
<b>Step 3</b> &minus; left points to the low index
<b>Step 4</b> &minus; right points to the high
<b>Step 5</b> &minus; while value at left is less than pivot move right
<b>Step 6</b> &minus; while value at right is greater than pivot move left
<b>Step 7</b> &minus; if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right
<b>Step 8</b> &minus; if left &ge; right, the point where they met is new pivot
</pre>
<h2>Quick Sort Pivot Pseudocode</h2>
<p>The pseudocode for the above algorithm can be derived as &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
function partitionFunc(left, right, pivot)
   leftPointer = left - 1
   rightPointer = right

   while True do
      while A[&plus;&plus;leftPointer] &lt; pivot do
         //do-nothing            
      end while
		
      while rightPointer &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; A[--rightPointer] &gt; pivot do
         //do-nothing         
      end while
		
      if leftPointer &gt;= rightPointer
         break
      else                
         swap leftPointer,rightPointer
      end if
		
   end while 
	
   swap leftPointer,right
   return leftPointer
	
end function
</pre>
<h2>Quick Sort Algorithm</h2>
<p>Using pivot algorithm recursively, we end up with smaller possible partitions. Each partition is then processed for quick sort. We define recursive algorithm for quicksort as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
<b>Step 1</b> &minus; Make the right-most index value pivot
<b>Step 2</b> &minus; partition the array using pivot value
<b>Step 3</b> &minus; quicksort left partition recursively
<b>Step 4</b> &minus; quicksort right partition recursively
</pre>
<h2>Quick Sort Pseudocode</h2>
<p>To get more into it, let see the pseudocode for quick sort algorithm &minus;</p>

<h1>Data Structure - Graph Data Structure</h1>
<p>A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as <b>vertices</b>, and the links that connect the vertices are called <b>edges</b>.</p>
<p>Formally, a graph is a pair of sets <b>(V, E)</b>, where <b>V</b> is the set of vertices and <b>E</b> is the set of edges, connecting the pairs of vertices. Take a look at the following graph &minus;</p>

<h2>Graph Data Structure</h2>
<p>Mathematical graphs can be represented in data structure. We can represent a graph using an array of vertices and a two-dimensional array of edges. Before we proceed further, let's familiarize ourselves with some important terms &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Vertex</b> &minus; Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex. In the following example, the labeled circle represents vertices. Thus, A to G are vertices. We can represent them using an array as shown in the following image. Here A can be identified by index 0. B can be identified using index 1 and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Edge</b> &minus; Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices. In the following example, the lines from A to B, B to C, and so on represents edges. We can use a two-dimensional array to represent an array as shown in the following image. Here AB can be represented as 1 at row 0, column 1, BC as 1 at row 1, column 2 and so on, keeping other combinations as 0.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Adjacency</b> &minus; Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge. In the following example, B is adjacent to A, C is adjacent to B, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Path</b> &minus; Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices. In the following example, ABCD represents a path from A to D.</p></li>

<h1>Data Structure &amp; Algorithms - Tree Traversal</h1>

<p>Traversal is a process to visit all the nodes of a tree and may print their values too. Because, all nodes are connected via edges (links) we always start from the root (head) node. That is, we cannot randomly access a node in a tree. There are three ways which we use to traverse a tree &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>In-order Traversal</li>
<li>Pre-order Traversal</li>
<li>Post-order Traversal</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, we traverse a tree to search or locate a given item or key in the tree or to print all the values it contains.</p>
<h2>In-order Traversal</h2>
<p>In this traversal method, the left subtree is visited first, then the root and later the right sub-tree. We should always remember that every node may represent a subtree itself.</p>
<p>If a binary tree is traversed <b>in-order</b>, the output will produce sorted key values in an ascending order.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/inorder_traversal.jpg" alt="In Order Traversal" />
<p>We start from <b>A</b>, and following in-order traversal, we move to its left subtree <b>B</b>. <b>B</b> is also traversed in-order. The process goes on until all the nodes are visited. The output of inorder traversal of this tree will be &minus;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>D &rarr; B &rarr; E &rarr; A &rarr; F &rarr; C &rarr; G</i></b></p>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Until all nodes are traversed &minus;
<b>Step 1</b> &minus; Recursively traverse left subtree.
<b>Step 2</b> &minus; Visit root node.
<b>Step 3</b> &minus; Recursively traverse right subtree.
</pre>
<h2>Pre-order Traversal</h2>
<p>In this traversal method, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree and finally the right subtree.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/preorder_traversal.jpg" alt="Pre Order Traversal" />
<p>We start from <b>A</b>, and following pre-order traversal, we first visit <b>A</b> itself and then move to its left subtree <b>B</b>. <b>B</b> is also traversed pre-order. The process goes on until all the nodes are visited. The output of pre-order traversal of this tree will be &minus;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>A &rarr; B &rarr; D &rarr; E &rarr; C &rarr; F &rarr; G</i></b></p>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Until all nodes are traversed &minus;
<b>Step 1</b> &minus; Visit root node.
<b>Step 2</b> &minus; Recursively traverse left subtree.
<b>Step 3</b> &minus; Recursively traverse right subtree.
</pre>
<h2>Post-order Traversal</h2>
<p>In this traversal method, the root node is visited last, hence the name. First we traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree and finally the root node.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/postorder_traversal.jpg" alt="Post Order Traversal" />
<p>We start from <b>A</b>, and following Post-order traversal, we first visit the left subtree <b>B</b>. <b>B</b> is also traversed post-order. The process goes on until all the nodes are visited. The output of post-order traversal of this tree will be &minus;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>D &rarr; E &rarr; B &rarr; F &rarr; G &rarr; C &rarr; A</i></b></p>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Until all nodes are traversed &minus;
<b>Step 1</b> &minus; Recursively traverse left subtree.
<b>Step 2</b> &minus; Recursively traverse right subtree.
<b>Step 3</b> &minus; Visit root node.

<h1>Data Structure - Recursion Basics</h1>

<p>Some computer programming languages allow a module or function to call itself. This technique is known as recursion. In recursion, a function <b>&alpha;</b> either calls itself directly or calls a function <b>&beta;</b> that in turn calls the original function <b>&alpha;</b>. The function <b>&alpha;</b> is called recursive function.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; a function calling itself.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
int function(int value) {
   if(value &lt; 1)
      return;
   function(value - 1);
	
   printf("%d ",value);   
}
</pre>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; a function that calls another function which in turn calls it again.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
int function(int value) {
   if(value &lt; 1)
      return;
   function(value - 1);
	
   printf("%d ",value);   
}
</pre>
<h2>Properties</h2> 
<p>A recursive function can go infinite like a loop. To avoid infinite running of recursive function, there are two properties that a recursive function must have &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Base criteria</b> &minus; There must be at least one base criteria or condition, such that, when this condition is met the function stops calling itself recursively.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Progressive approach</b> &minus; The recursive calls should progress in such a way that each time a recursive call is made it comes closer to the base criteria.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Many programming languages implement recursion by means of <b>stacks</b>. Generally, whenever a function (<b>caller</b>) calls another function (<b>callee</b>) or itself as callee, the caller function transfers execution control to the callee. This transfer process may also involve some data to be passed from the caller to the callee.</p>
<p>This implies, the caller function has to suspend its execution temporarily and resume later when the execution control returns from the callee function. Here, the caller function needs to start exactly from the point of execution where it puts itself on hold. It also needs the exact same data values it was working on. For this purpose, an activation record (or stack frame) is created for the caller function.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/activation_records.jpg" alt="Activation Records" />
<p>This activation record keeps the information about local variables, formal parameters, return address and all information passed to the caller function.</p>
<h2>Analysis of Recursion</h2>
<p>One may argue why to use recursion, as the same task can be done with iteration. The first reason is, recursion makes a program more readable and because of latest enhanced CPU systems, recursion is more efficient than iterations.</p>
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
<p>In case of iterations, we take number of iterations to count the time complexity. Likewise, in case of recursion, assuming everything is constant, we try to figure out the number of times a recursive call is being made. A call made to a function is &Omicron;(1), hence the (n) number of times a recursive call is made makes the recursive function &Omicron;(n).</p>
<h2>Space Complexity</h2>
<p>Space complexity is counted as what amount of extra space is required for a module to execute. In case of iterations, the compiler hardly requires any extra space. The compiler keeps updating the values of variables used in the iterations. But in case of recursion, the system needs to store activation record each time a recursive call is made. Hence, it is considered that space complexity of recursive function may go higher than that of a function with iteration.</p>
