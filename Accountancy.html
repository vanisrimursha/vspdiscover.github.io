<h1>Accounting - Overview</h1>

<p>Accounting is a business language. We can use this language to communicate financial transactions and their results. Accounting is a comprehensive system to collect, analyze, and communicate financial information.</p>
<p>The origin of accounting is as old as money. In early days, the number of transactions were very small, so every concerned person could keep the record of transactions during a specific period of time. Twenty-three centuries ago, an Indian scholar named <b>Kautilya</b> alias <b>Chanakya</b> introduced the accounting concepts in his book <b>Arthashastra</b>. In his book, he described the art of proper account keeping and methods of checking accounts. Gradually, the field of accounting has undergone remarkable changes in compliance with the changes happening in the business scenario of the world.</p>
<p>A book-keeper may record financial transactions according to certain accounting principles and standards and as prescribed by an accountant depending upon the size, nature, volume, and other constraints of a particular organization.</p>
<p>With the help of accounting process, we can determine the profit or loss of the business on a specific date. It also helps us analyze the past performance and plan the future courses of action.</p>
<h2>Definition of Accounting</h2>
<p>The American <i>Institute of Certified Public Accountant</i> has defined Financial Accounting as:</p>
<blockquote>
“the art of recording, classifying and summarizing in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which in part at least of a financial character and interpreting the results thereof.”
</blockquote>
<h2>Objectives and Scope of Accounting</h2>
<p>Let us go through the main objectives of Accounting:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>To keep systematic records</b> - Accounting is done to keep systematic record of financial transactions. The primary objective of accounting is to help us collect financial data and to record it systematically to derive correct and useful results of financial statements.</p></li>
<li><p><b>To ascertain profitability</b> - With the help of accounting, we can evaluate the profits and losses incurred during a specific accounting period. With the help of a Trading and Profit & Loss Account, we can easily determine the profit or loss of a firm.</p></li>
<li><p><b>To ascertain the financial position of the business</b> - A balance sheet or a statement of affairs indicates the financial position of a company as on a particular date. A properly drawn balance sheet gives us an indication of the class and value of assets, the nature and value of liability, and also the capital position of the firm. With the help of that, we can easily ascertain the soundness of any business entity.</p></li>
<li><p><b>To assist in decision-making</b> - To take decisions for the future, one requires accurate financial statements. One of the main objectives of accounting is to take right decisions at right time. Thus, accounting gives you the platform to plan for the future with the help of past records.</p></li>
<li><p><b>To fulfill compliance of Law</b> - Business entities such as companies, trusts, and societies are being run and governed according to different legislative acts. Similarly, different taxation laws (direct indirect tax) are also applicable to every business house. Everyone has to keep and maintain different types of accounts and records as prescribed by corresponding laws of the land. Accounting helps in running a business in compliance with the law.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="c2" class="tabcontent">
<h1>Accounting - Basic Concepts</h1>

<p>The first two accounting concepts, namely, Business Entity Concept and Money Measurement Concept are the fundamental concepts of accounting. Let us go through each one of them briefly:</p>
<h2>Business Entity Concept</h2>
<p>According to this concept, the business and the owner of the business are two different entities. In other words, I and my business are separate.</p>
<p>For example, Mr A starts a new business in the name and style of M/s Independent Trading Company and introduced a capital of Rs 2,00,000 in cash. It means the cash balance of M/s Independent Trading Company will increase by a sum of Rs 2,00,000/-. At the same time, the liability of M/s Independent Trading Company in the form of capital will also increase. It means M/s Independent Trading Company is liable to pay Rs 2,00,000 to Mr A.</p>
<h2>Money Measurement Concept</h2>
<p>According to this concept, “we can book only those transactions in our accounting record which can be measured in monetary terms.”</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Determine and book the value of stock of the following items:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Shirts   Rs 5,000/-
Pants    Rs 7,500/-

Coats    500 pieces
Jackets  1000 pieces

Value of Stock = ?
</pre>
<p>Here, if we want to book the value of stock in our accounting record, we need the value of coats and jackets in terms of money. Now if we conclude that the values of coats and jackets are Rs 2,000 and Rs 15,000 respectively, then we can easily book the value of stock as Rs 29,500 (as a result of 5000+7500+2000+15000) in our books. We need to keep quantitative records separately.</p>
<h2>Going Concern Concept</h2>
<p>Our accounting is based on the assumption that a business unit is a going concern. We record all the financial transaction of a business in keeping this point of view in our mind that a business unit is a going concern; not a gone concern. Otherwise, the banker will not provide loans, the supplier will not supply goods or services, the employees will not work properly, and the method of recording the transaction will change altogether.</p>
<p>For example, a business unit makes investments in the form of fixed assets and we book only depreciation of the assets in our profit &amp; loss account; not the difference of acquisition cost of assets less net realizable value of the assets. The reason is simple; we assume that we will use these assets and earn profit in the future while using them. Similarly, we treat deferred revenue expenditure and prepaid expenditure. The concept of going concern does not work in the following cases:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>If a unit is declared sick (unused or unusable unit).</li>
<li>When a company is going to liquidate and a liquidator is appointed for the same.</li>
<li>When a business unit is passing through severe financial crisis and going to wind up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost Concept</h2>
<p>It is a very important concept based on the Going Concern Concept. We book the value of assets on the cost basis, not on the net realizable value or market value of the assets based on the assumption that a business unit is a going concern. No doubt, we reduce the value of assets providing depreciation to assets, but we ignore the market value of the assets.</p>
<p>The cost concept stops any kind of manipulation while taking into account the net realizable value or the market value. On the downside, this concept ignores the effect of inflation in the market, which can sometimes be very steep. Still, the cost concept is widely and universally accepted on the basis of which we do the accounting of a business unit.</p>
<h2>Dual Aspect Concept</h2>
<p>There must be a double entry to complete any financial transaction, means debit should be always equal to credit. Hence, every financial transaction has its dual aspect:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>we get some benefit, and</li>
<li>we pay some benefit.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if we buy some stock, then it will have two effects:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>the value of stock will increase (get benefit for the same amount), and</li>
<li>it will increase our liability in the form of creditors.</li>
</ul>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="width:38%;">Transaction</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="middle">Purchase of Stock for Rs 25,000</td>
<td>
<p>Stock will increase by Rs 25,000 (Increase in debit balance)</p>
<p>Cash will decrease by Rs 25,000 (Decrease in debit balance)</p>
<p id="center">or</p>
<p>Creditor will increase by Rs 25,000 (Increase in credit balance)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Accounting Period Concept</h2>
<p>The life of a business unit is indefinite as per the going concern concept. To determine the profit or loss of a firm, and to ascertain its financial position, profit &amp; loss accounts and balance sheets are prepared at regular intervals of time, usually at the end of each year. This one-year cycle is known as the accounting period. The purpose of having an accounting period is to take corrective measures keeping in view the past performances, to nullify the effect of seasonal changes, to pay taxes, etc.</p>
<p>Based on this concept, revenue expenditure and capital expenditure are segregated. Revenues expenditure are debited to the profit &amp; loss account to ascertain correct profit or loss during a particular accounting period. Capital expenditure comes in the category of those expenses, the benefit of which will be utilized in the next coming accounting periods as well.</p>
<p>Accounting period helps us ascertain correct position of the firm at regular intervals of time, i.e., at the end of each accounting period.</p>
<h2>Matching Concept</h2>
<p>Matching concept is based on the accounting period concept. The expenditures of a firm for a particular accounting period are to be matched with the revenue of the same accounting period to ascertain accurate profit or loss of the firm for the same period. This practice of matching is widely accepted all over the world. Let us take an example to understand the Matching Concept clearly.</p>
<p>The following data is received from M/s Globe Enterprises during the period 01-04-2012 to 31-03-2013:</p>

</table>
<p>In the above example, to match expenditures and revenues during the same accounting period, we added the credit purchase as well as the outstanding expenses of this accounting year to ascertain the correct profit for the accounting period 01-04-2012 to 31-03-2013.</p>
<p>It means the collection of cash and payment in cash is ignored while calculating the profit or loss of the year.</p>
<h2>Accrual Concept</h2>
<p>As stated above in the matching concept, the revenue generated in the accounting period is considered and the expenditure related to the accounting period is also considered. Based on the accrual concept of accounting, if we sell some items or we rendered some service, then that becomes our point of revenue generation irrespective of whether we received cash or not. The same concept is applicable in case of expenses. All the expenses paid in cash or payable are considered and the advance payment of expenses, if any, is deducted.</p>
<p>Most of the professionals use cash basis of accounting. It means, the cash received in a particular accounting period and the expenses paid cash in the same accounting period is the basis of their accounting. For them, the income of their firm depends upon the collection of revenue in cash. Similar practice is followed for expenditures. It is convenient for them and on the same basis, they pay their Taxes.</p>
<h2>Objective Evidence Concept</h2>
<p>According to the Objective Evidence concept, every financial entry should be supported by some objective evidence. Purchase should be supported by purchase bills, sale with sale bills, cash payment of expenditure with cash memos, and payment to creditors with cash receipts and bank statements. Similarly, stock should be checked by physical verification and the value of it should be verified with purchase bills. In the absence of these, the accounting result will not be trustworthy, chances of manipulation in accounting records will be high, and no one will be able to rely on such financial statements.</p>

<h1>Accounting - Conventions</h1>

<p>We will discuss the accounting conventions in this section.</p>
<h2>Convention of Consistency</h2>
<p>To compare the results of different years, it is necessary that accounting rules, principles, conventions and accounting concepts for similar transactions are followed consistently and continuously. Reliability of financial statements may be lost, if frequent changes are observed in accounting treatment. For example, if a firm chooses cost or <i>market price whichever is lower</i> method for stock valuation and <i>written down value method</i> for depreciation to fixed assets, it should be followed consistently and continuously.</p>
<p>Consistency also states that if a change becomes necessary, the change and its effects on profit or loss and on the financial position of the company should be clearly mentioned.</p>
<h2>Convention of Disclosure</h2>
<p>The Companies Act, 1956, prescribed a format in which financial statements must be prepared. Every company that fall under this category has to follow this practice. Various provisions are made by the Companies Act to prepare these financial statements. The purpose of these provisions is to disclose all essential information so that the view of financial statements should be true and fair. However, the term ‘disclosure’ does not mean all information. It means disclosure of information that is significance to the users of these financial statements, such as investors, owner, and creditors.</p>
<h2>Convention of Materiality</h2>
<p>If the disclosure or non-disclosure of an information might influence the decision of the users of financial statements, then that information should be disclosed.</p>
<p>For better understanding, please refer to General Instruction for preparation of Statement of Profit and Loss in revised scheduled VI to the Companies Act, 1956:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company shall disclose by way of notes additional information regarding any item of income or expenditure which exceeds 1% of the revenue from operations or Rs 1,00,000 whichever is higher.</p></li>
<li><p>A Company shall disclose in Notes to Accounts, share in the company held by each shareholder holding more than 5% share specifying the number of share held.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conservation or Prudence</h2>
<p>It is a policy of playing safe. For future events, profits are not anticipated, but provisions for losses are provided as a policy of conservatism. Under this policy, provisions are made for doubtful debts as well as contingent liability; but we do not consider any anticipatory gain.</p>
<p>For example, If A purchases 1000 items @ Rs 80 per item and sells 900 items out of them @ Rs 100 per item when the market value of stock is (i) Rs 90 and in condition (ii) Rs 70 per item, then the profit from the above transactions can be calculated as follows:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

<th style="text-align:right;width:20%;">Condition(ii)</th>

<td id="td"></td>
<td id="td"></td>

<tr>
<td id="td">Sale Value (A) (900x100)</td>
<td id="td" class="right">90,000.00</td>
<td id="td" class="right">90,000.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="td">Less - Cost of Goods Sold</td>
<td id="td"></td>
<td id="td"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="td" style="padding-left:40px;">Purchases</td>
<td id="td" class="right">80,000.00</td>
<td id="td" class="right">80,000.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="td">Less - Closing Stock</td>
<td id="td" style="border-bottom:1pt solid black;text-align:right;">8,000.00</td>
<td id="td" style="border-bottom:1pt solid black;text-align:right;">7,000.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="td">Cost of Goods Sold (B)</td>
<td id="td" class="right">72,000.00</td>
<td id="td" class="right">73,000.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="td" style="font-weight:bold;">Profit(A-B)</td>
<td id="td" class="right"  style="font-weight:bold;">18,000.00</td>
<td id="td" class="right"  style="font-weight:bold;">17,000.00</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In the above example, the method for valuation of stock is <i>‘Cost or market price whichever is lower’</i>.</p>
<p>The prudence however does not permit creation of hidden reserve by understating
the profits or by overstating the losses.</p>

<h1>Accounting - Classification of Accounts</h1>

<p>It is necessary to know the classification of accounts and their treatment in double entry system of accounts. Broadly, the accounts are classified into three
categories:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Personal accounts</li>
<li>Real accounts
<ul class="list">
<li>Tangible accounts</li>
<li>Intangible accounts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us go through them each of them one by one.</p>
<h2>Personal Accounts</h2>
<p>Personal accounts may be further classified into three categories:</p>
<h3>Natural Personal Account</h3>
<p>An account related to any individual like David, George, Ram, or Shyam is
called as a <i>Natural Personal Account</i>.</p>
<h3>Artificial Personal Account</h3>
<p>An account related to any artificial person like M/s ABC Ltd, M/s General
Trading, M/s Reliance Industries, etc., is called as an <i>Artificial Personal
Account</i>.</p>
<h3>Representative Personal Account</h3>
<p>Representative personal account represents a group of account. If there are a
number of accounts of similar nature, it is better to group them like salary payable account, rent payable account, insurance prepaid account, interest receivable account, capital account and drawing account, etc.</p>
<h2>Real Accounts</h2>
<p>Every Business has some assets and every asset has an account. Thus, asset account is called a real account. There are two type of assets:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Tangible</b> assets are touchable assets such as plant, machinery, furniture, stock, cash, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Intangible</b> assets are non-touchable assets such as goodwill, patent, copyrights, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Accounting treatment for both type of assets is same.</p>
<h2>Nominal Accounts</h2>
<p>Since this account does not represent any tangible asset, it is called nominal or fictitious account. All kinds of expense account, loss account, gain account or income accounts come under the category of nominal account. For example, rent account, salary account, electricity expenses account, interest income account, etc.</p>

<h1>Financial Accounting - Journal</h1>

<blockquote>“The process of recording a transaction in a journal is called journalizing the transactions.”
<p style="text-align:right;margin-bottom:.3em;">---Meigs and Meigs and Johnson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Journal is a book that is maintained on a daily basis for recording all the financial entries of the day. Passing the entries is called journal entry. Journal entries are passed according to rules of debit and credit of double entry system.</p>

<p>Trade discount is allowed by seller to buyer directly on their sales invoice.

Rate of discount may vary from customer to customer.</p>
<p><b>Treatment</b> - No need to pass any journal entry in this case. The sale is booked on the net of trade discount. Similarly, if we get trade discount from our supplier, we book our purchase at the net of trade discount.</p>

<h1>Financial Accounting - Ledger</h1>

<p>Now let us try to understand how a journal works. With the help of journal entries, we book each and every financial transaction of the organization chronically without considering how many times the same type of entry has been repeated in that particular accounting year or period.</p>
<p>Journal entries in any organization may vary from hundreds to millions depending upon the size and structure of the organization. With the help of a journal, each of the transactions might be recorded; however, we can conclude nothing from a journal. Let us consider the following cases. Suppose we want to know:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>the total sale value or purchase value</li>
<li>the total of any particular income or expenses</li>
<li>the total of amount payable to any particular creditor or receivable from a debtor</li>
</ul>
<p>In such cases, it might be a tedious job for any bookkeeper or accountant. Hence, the next step is ledger accounts.</p>
<p>The ledger helps us in summarizing journal entries of same nature at single place. For example, if we pass 100 times a journal entry for sale, we can create a sales account only once and post all the sales transaction in that ledger account date-wise. Hence, an unlimited number of journal entries can be summarized in a few ledger accounts. Transferring journal entries into a ledger account is called <b>‘posting’</b>.</p>
<h2>Ruling of Account in Ledger Account</h2>
<p>Let us see various formats of ledger accounts:</p>
<h3>Format-1</h3>

<h3>Format-2</h3>
<p>Nowadays, the handwritten books are being replaced by computerized accounts. The companies majorly use a six-column format to maintain ledger accounts of their customers. It looks as follows:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

<p>Format-1 is used for academic purpose. Hence, this format is useful to learn the basics and principles of accounting.</p>
<p>Format-2 is used by banking and financial organization as well as well as by most of the business organizations.</p>
<h2>Important Points Regarding Ledger</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Each side of a journal entry is posted in the same side of the ledger. It means the debit entry of a journal is posted in the debit side and vice-a-versa.</p></li>
<li><p>Balance c/d refers to the balance carried down and balance b/d refers to the balance brought down.</p></li>
<li><p>After posting in ledger, balancing of ledger is done. In the column named Total, the figure comes on the basis of <b>‘whichever is higher’</b>. Means, if the total of debit side is Rs 10,000 and the total of credit is Rs 5,000, we write Rs 10,000 in the column named Total of both, the debit and the credit side.</p></li>
<li><p>The difference of both sides (in this case, it is Rs 5,000) is written in the last row of the credit side as <b>‘balance c/d’</b>. This balance is called the debit balance of account or vice-a-versa.</p></li>
<li><p>All expenses and assets represent debit balance.</p></li>
<li><p>All the income and liabilities represent credit balance including capital account.</p></li>
<li><p>Debit balance of personal account represents <b>‘Amount Receivable’</b>. This comes under the category of assets. For example debtors.</p></li>
<li><p>Credit balance of personal accounts signifies <b>‘Amount Payable’</b>. This comes under liabilities side and represents that we need to pay this amount which is credited due to goods, service, loan, or advance received.</p></li>
<li><p>Debit side of real account means stock in hand or any kind of assets. Credit balance of Real account is not possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Debit balance of nominal account means expenses of organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Credit balance of nominal accounts means income earned.</p></li>
<li><p>Debit balance of cash book means cash in hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Debit side of Bank book means balance at bank.</p></li>
<li><p>Credit balance of Bank book indicates <b>‘Bank Overdraft’</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Debit and credit balances of nominal account (Expenses and income will be nil, because these balances get transferred to trading, and profit &amp; loss account to arrive at profit and loss of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Balances of real and personal account appear in balance sheet of the company and to be carried forward to next accounting years.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Financial Accounting - Depreciation</h1>

<p>Depreciation reduces the value of assets on a residual basis. It also reduces the profits of the current year.</p>
<p>Depreciation indicates reduction in value of any fixed assets. Reduction in value of assets depends on the life of assets. Life of assets depends upon the usage of assets.</p>
<p>There are many deciding factors that ascertain the life of assets. For example, in case of a building, the deciding factor is time. In case of leased assets, the deciding factor is the lease period. For plant and machinery, the deciding factor should be production as well as time. There can be many factors, but the life of assets should be ascertained on some reasonable basis.</p>
<h2>Why Do We Need to Account for Depreciation?</h2>
<p>Here is why we need to provide depreciation:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To ascertain the true profit during a year, it is desirable to charge depreciation.</p></li>
<li><p>To ascertain the true value of assets, depreciation should be charged. Without calculating the correct value of assets, we cannot ascertain the true financial position of a company.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of withdrawal of overstated profit, it is desirable to make provisions to buy new assets to replace old asset. The accumulated value of depreciation provides additional working capital.</p></li>
<li><p>Depreciation helps in ascertaining uniform profit in each accounting year.</p></li>
<li><p>Depreciation allows to take the advantage of tax benefit.</p></li>

<h1>Cost Accounting -  Cost Sheet</h1>

<p>A cost sheet is prepared to know the outcome and breakup of costs for a particular accounting period. Columnar form is most popular. Although cost sheets are prepared as per the requirements of the management, the information to be incorporated in a cost sheet should comprise of cost per unit and the total cost for the current period along with the cost per unit and the total cost of preceding period. Data of financial statement is used for preparation of cost sheet. Therefore, reconciliation of cost sheet and financial statement should be done on a regular interval.</p>

<h1>Cost Accounting - Cost Control</h1>

<blockquote>
Conceptually, accounting is the discipline that provides information on which external and internal users of the information may base decision that result in the allocation of economic resource in society.
<p style="text-align:right;margin-bottom:.3em;">...Slavin and Reynolds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accounting provides business-related information to the owner, the management, the employees of the company as well as to the government, creditors, investors, and customers.</p>
<p>Financial accounting is based on actual past and cost accounting is based on planning and controlling. Preparation of budget is a part of planning and controlling relates to putting a check on the actual function of planning. Comparison of budgeted with actual performance provide the management an idea to eliminate weak performances.</p>
<h2>Cost Control Techniques</h2>
<p>Costs can be controlling by employing the following methods:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Material Control</li>
<li>Labor Control</li>
<li>Overheads Control</li>
<li>Standard costing</li>
<li>Budgetary Control</li>
<li>Capital Expenditure Control</li>
<li>Productivity and Accounting Ratios</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements for Successful Cost Control</h2>
<p>The following requirements are to be fulfilled to implement successful cost control:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A plan and a set of well-defined responsibilities to all executives are essential.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear definition of tasks for performance and cost to execute those tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>A fixed responsibility, in case of deviation between targeted and actual.</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt collection of performance data from each department of an organization as the delay in information equals to no information and the management is unable to take correct decision due to lack of complete information.</p></li>
<li><p>Highlights of good and bad, both performances to enable the management to take corrective steps.</p></li>
<li><p>Reward for good performances and Punishment for the poor ones.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />



<h1>Cost Accounting - Cost Reduction</h1>

<blockquote>
Cost reduction is to be understood as the achievement of real and permanent reduction in the unit cost of goods manufactured or services rendered without impairing their suitability for the use intended or diminution in the quality of product.
<p style="text-align:right;margin-bottom:.3em;">… The institute of Management Accountants, London</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are only two ways to maximize profit of any organization: either to increase sale price of unit, or to reduce cost of that unit. Both above cases may result into gaining good profit. As we are seeing today, most of the businesses are facing tough competitive market situation where increase in sale price may result in to loss of sale. Increasing sale price is possible only in case of those products where the company is dealing in monopoly items and we all are aware that this situation cannot prolong for any company and its products. Therefore, cost reduction is only one scientific way to deal with this situation; provided it is real and permanent. Cost reduction should not be the result of any temporary decrement in cost of raw material, change in government polices etc. and most importantly, reduction of cost should not be on price of quality of that product.</p>
<p>Reduction of cost should be in the following manner:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Volume of production should be same but cost of expenditure should be reduced.</li>
<li>Without changing level of production there should be increase in production.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost Reduction Program</h2>
<p>Followings are the essentials of a cost reduction program:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Cost reduction program should be according to requirement of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost reduction program is a continuous activity that cannot be treated as one time or short term activity. Success of any cost reduction program may lie in only continuous improvement of efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost reduction program should be real and permanent.</p></li>
<li><p>Example setter of cost reduction program should be top management employee. Success of this program depends on co-operation of all employees and department of an organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Employees should be rewarded for their participation in cost reduction program and for giving innovative ideas related to this program.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Fields Covered under the Cost Reduction Program</h2>
<p>A number of fields come under the scope of cost reduction. They are discussed below.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Manufacturing of any product starts with the design of product. At the time of improvement in design of old product as well as at the time of designing new product, some investment is recommended to find a useful design that may reduce the cost of the product in following terms:</p>
<p><b>Material Cost</b></p>
<p>Design of product should encourage to find out possibility of cheaper raw material as a substitute, maximum production, less quantity etc.</p>
<p><b>Labor Cost</b></p>
<p>Design of product may reduce time of operation, cost of after-sale service, minimum tolerance, etc.</p>
<p><b>Organization</b></p>
<p>Employees should be encouraged for cost reduction scheme. There should be no scope for doubts and frictions; there should be no communication gap between any department or any level of management; and there must be proper delegation of responsibilities with defined area of functions of an organization.</p>
<p><b>Factory Layout and Equipment</b></p>
<p>There should be a proper study about unused utilization of material, manpower and machines, maximum utilization of all above may reduce cost of any product effectively.</p>
<p><b>Administration</b></p>
<p>An organization should make efforts to reduce the cost of administrative expenses, as there is ample scope to do so. A company may evaluate and reduce the cost of following expenses, but not the cost of efficiency:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Telephone expenses</li>
<li>Travelling expenses</li>
<li>Salary by reducing staff</li>
<li>Reduction in cost of stationery</li>
<li>Postage and Telegrams</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Marketing</b></p>
<p>Following areas can be covered under the cost reduction program:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Advertisement</li>
<li>Warehouse</li>
<li>Sales Promotion</li>
<li>Distribution Expenses</li>
<li>Research & Development Program</li>
</ul>
<p>Any cost accountant should keep the following points in mind while focusing on cost reduction for the Marketing segment:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Check the distribution system of an organization about the overall efficiency of the system and how economically that system is working.</p></li>
<li><p>Find out the efficiency of the sales promotion system</p></li>
<li><p>Find out if the costs can reduced from the sales and distribution system of an organization and whether the research and development system of market is sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>A cost accountant should also do an ABC analysis of customers in which customers may be divided into three categories. For example:</p></li>
</ul>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th colspan="3">ABC ANALYSIS OF CUSTOMERS</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Category</td>
<td>Number of Dispatches</td>
<td>Volume of Sale Covered</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Customer...A</td>
<td>About 10%</td>
<td>60% to 80%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Customer...B</td>
<td>About 20%</td>
<td>20% to 30%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Customer...C</td>
<td>About 70%</td>
<td>5% to 10%</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>After performing this analysis, the organization can focus on the customers who are covering most of the sales volume. According to it, the cost reduction program may be run successfully in the area of category B and C.</p>
<h2>Financial Management</h2>
<p>Attention should be given to the following areas:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If there is any over-investment.</p></li>
<li><p>How much economical is the cost of capital received?</p></li>
<li><p>If the organization is getting maximum returns for the capital employed.</p>
<li><p>If there is any over-investment, that should be sold and similarly, unutilized fixed assets should be eliminated. Slow-moving or non-moving inventories should be removed and should transfer this surplus to the working capital to re-invest it in a cycle of more profitable area of business.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal Management</h2>
<p>Cost reduction programs can be run using staff welfare measures and improving labor relation. Introduction of incentive schemes for labor and giving them better working conditions is very important to run an efficient cost reduction program.</p>
<h2>Material Control</h2>
<p>Cost reduction program should be run by purchasing economical and more useful material. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) technique should be used. Inventory should be kept low. Proper check on inward material, control over warehouse and proper issuance of material, and effective material yield should be done.</p>
<h2>Production</h2>
<p>Using effective control over material, labor, and machine a better cost reduction program may be run.</p>
<h2>Tools and Techniques of Cost Reduction</h2>
<p>The following tools and techniques are used to reduce costs:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Budgetary Control</li>
<li>Standard Costing</li>
<li>Simplification and Variety Reduction</li>
<li>Planning and Control of Finance</li>
<li>Cost Benefit Analysis</li>
<li>Value Analysis</li>
<li>Contribution Analysis</li>
<li>Job Evaluation and Merit Rating</li>
<li>Improvement in Design</li>
<li>Material Control</li>
<li>Labor Control</li>
<li>Overhead Control</li>

<h1>Cost Accounting - Marginal Costing</h1>

<p>Marginal cost is the change in the total cost when the quantity produced is incremented by one. That is, it is the cost of producing one more unit of a good. For example, let us suppose:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Variable cost per unit     = Rs 25
Fixed cost                 = Rs 1,00,000
Cost of 10,000 units       = 25 × 10,000 = Rs 2,50,000
Total Cost of 10,000 units = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost
                           = 1,00,000 + 2,50,000
                           = Rs 3,50,000
Total cost of 10,001 units = 1,00,000 + 2,50,025
                           = Rs 3,50,025
Marginal Cost              = 3,50,025 – 3,50,000
                           = Rs 25
</pre>
<h2>Need for Marginal Costing</h2>
<p>Let us see why marginal costing is required:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Variable cost per unit remains constant; any increase or decrease in production changes the total cost of output.</p></li>
<li><p>Total fixed cost remains unchanged up to a certain level of production and does not vary with increase or decrease in production. It means the fixed cost remains constant in terms of total cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed expenses exclude from the total cost in marginal costing technique and provide us the same cost per unit up to a certain level of production.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Features of Marginal Costing</h2>
<p>Features of marginal costing are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Marginal costing is used to know the impact of variable cost on the volume of production or output.</p></li>
<li><p>Break-even analysis is an integral and important part of marginal costing.</p></li>
<li><p>Contribution of each product or department is a foundation to know the profitability of the product or department.</p></li>
<li><p>Addition of variable cost and profit to contribution is equal to selling price.</p></li>
<li><p>Marginal costing is the base of valuation of stock of finished product and work in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed cost is recovered from contribution and variable cost is charged to production.</p></li>
<li><p>Costs are classified on the basis of fixed and variable costs only. Semi-fixed prices are also converted either as fixed cost or as variable cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Ascertainment of Profit under Marginal Cost</h2>
<p>‘Contribution’ is a fund that is equal to the selling price of a product less marginal cost. Contribution may be described as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Contribution                  = Selling Price – Marginal Cost
Contribution                  = Fixed Expenses + Profit
Contribution – Fixed Expenses = Profit
</pre>

<h2>Advantages of Marginal Costing</h2>
<p>The advantages of marginal costing are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Easy to operate and simple to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>Marginal costing is useful in profit planning; it is helpful to determine profitability at different level of production and sale.</p></li>
<li><p>It is useful in decision making about fixation of selling price, export decision and make or buy decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Break even analysis and P/V ratio are useful techniques of marginal costing.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluation of different departments is possible through marginal costing.</p></li>
<li><p>By avoiding arbitrary allocation of fixed cost, it provides control over variable cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed overhead recovery rate is easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Under marginal costing, valuation of inventory done at marginal cost. Therefore, it is not possible to carry forward illogical fixed overheads from one accounting period to the next period.</p></li>
<li><p>Since fixed cost is not controllable in short period, it helps to concentrate in control over variable cost.</p></li>

<h1>Cost Accounting - Standard Costing</h1>

<p>Planned cost is a key for effective cost control which is not provided by historical cost concepts. The standard costing system was developed to overcome the drawbacks of the historical costing system. Since historical costing deals only with the actual costs incurred, it is not an effective device of cost control.</p>
<p>Standard costing tells us what should be the cost of the product and if the actual cost exceeds the projected cost, the standard costing system can point to the reason of deviation.</p>
<h2>Points Related to Standard Costing</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Standard costing includes pre-determination of costs under specific working conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>In this process, the standard quantity of machine time, labor time, and material is calculated and the future market trend for price standards is analyzed.</p></li>
<li><p>Standard costing helps in variance analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Along with fixation of sale price, it also provides valuation of stock and work in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Material, labor, and overheads cost are ascertained.</p></li>
<li><p>Actual cost is measured.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Cost Accounting - CVP Analysis</h1>

<p>Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis is also known as Break–Even Analysis. Every business organization works to maximize its profits. With the help of CVP analysis, the management studies the co-relation of profit and the level of production.</p>
<p>CVP analysis is concerned with the level of activity where total sales equals the total cost and it is called as the break-even point. In other words, we study the sales value, cost and profit at different levels of production. CVP analysis highlights the relationship between the cost, the sales value, and the profit.</p>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>Let us go through the assumptions for CVP analysis:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Variable costs remain variable and fixed costs remain static at every level of production.</p></li>
<li><p>Sales volume does not affect the selling price of the product. We can assume the selling price as constant.</p></li>
<li><p>At all level of sales, the volume, material, and labor costs remain constant.</p></li>
<li><p>Efficiency and productivity remains unchanged at all the levels of sales volume.</p></li>
<li><p>The sales-mix at all level of sales remains constant in a multi-product situation.</p></li>
<li><p>The relevant factor which affects the cost and revenue is volume only.</p></li>
<li><p>The volume of sales is equal to the volume of production.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Marginal Cost Equation</h2>
<p>Equations for elements of cost are as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Sales = Variable costs + Fixed Expenses ± Profit /Loss

                     Or
                     
Sales – Variable Cost = Fixed Expenses ± Profit /Loss

                     Or
                     
Sales – Variable Cost = Contribution
</pre>
<p>It is necessary to understand the following four concepts, their calculations, and applications to know the mathematical relation between cost, volume, and profit:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Contribution</li>
<li>Profit Volume Ratio (P/V Ratio or Contribution/Sales (C/S))</li>
<li>Break-Even Point</li>
<li>Margin of Safety</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contribution</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Contribution = Sales – Marginal Cost
</pre>
<p>We have already discussed contribution in Marginal Costing topic above.</p>
<h3>Profit-Volume Ratio</h3>
<p>Profit / Volume (P/V) ratio is calculated while studying the profitability of operations of a business and to establish a relation between Sales and Contribution. It is one of the most important ratios, calculated as under:</p>
<div>
<sup>P</sup>&frasl;<sub>V</sub> Ratio = 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Contribution</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Sales</span>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:55px;">
= 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Fixed Expenses+Profit</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Sales</span>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:55px;">
= 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Sales-Variable Cost</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Sales</span>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:55px;">
= 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Change in profits of Contributions</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Change in Sales</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>The P/V Ratio shares a direct relation with profits. Higher the P/V ratio, more the profit and vice-a-versa.</p>
<h3>Break-Even Point</h3>
<p>When the total cost of executing business equals to the total sales, it is called break-even point. Contribution equals to the fixed cost at this point. Here is a formula to calculate break-even point:</p>
<div>
B.E.P (in units)  = 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Total Fixed Expenses</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Selling Price per Unit &minus; Marginal Cost per Unit</span>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:95px;">
= 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Total Fixed Expenses</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Contribution per Unit</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Break-even point based on total sales:</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;">
= 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Fixed Cost</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><sup>P</sup>&frasl;<sub>V</sub> Ratio</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Calculation of output or sales value at which a desired profit is earned:</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;">
= 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Fixed Expenses &plus; Desired Profit</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Selling Price per Unit &minus; Marginal Cost per Unit</span>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:40px;">
= 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Fixed Expenses &plus; Desired Profit</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Contribution per Unit</span>
</div>
</div>
<h4>Composite Break Even Point</h4>
<p>A company may have different production units, where they may produce the same product. In this case, the combined fixed cost of each productions unit and the combined total sales are taken into consideration to find out BEP.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Constant Product</b> - Mix Approach In this approach, the ratio is constant for the products of all production units.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Variable Product</b> - Mix Approach In this approach, the preference of products is based on bigger ratio.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Margin of Safety</h3>
<p>Excess of sale at BEP is known as margin of safety. Therefore,</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Margin of safety = Actual Sales &minus; Sales at BEP
</pre>
<p>Margin of safety may be calculated with the help of the following formula:</p>
<div>
Margin of Safety = 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Profit</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><sup>P</sup>&frasl;<sub>V</sub> Ratio</span>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:90px;">
= 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Profit</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Contribution per Unit</span>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Break-Even Chart</h2>
<p>Break-Even Chart is the most useful graphical representation of marginal costing. It converts accounting data to a useful readable report. Estimated profits, losses, and costs can be determined at different levels of production. Let us take an example.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Calculate break-even point and draw the break-even chart from the following data:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Fixed Cost    = Rs 2,50,000
Variable Cost = Rs 15 per unit
Selling Price = Rs 25 per unit
Production level in units 12,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, and 40,000.
</pre>
<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
<div style="padding-left:20px;">
B.E.P = 
<div class="fraction">

<span class="fdn">Rs 10 &times; (Rs 25 - Rs 15)</span>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:55px;">

</div>
<p>At production level of 25,000 units, the total cost will be Rs 6,25,000.</p>

<h1>Management Accounting - Ratio Analysis</h1>

<p>Ratio is an expression of relationship between two or more items in mathematical terms. Exhibition of meaningful and useful relation between different accounting data is called Accounting Ratio. Ratio may be expressed as a:b (a is to b), in terms of simple fraction, integer, or percentage.</p>
<p>If the current assets of a concern is Rs 4,00,000 and the current liabilities is Rs 2,00,000, then the ratio of current assets to current liabilities is given as 4,00,000 / 2,00,000 = 2. This is called simple ratio. Multiply a ratio by 100 to express it in terms of percentage.</p>
<p>We can express the ratio between 200 and 100 in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>2 : 1</li>
<li>2/1</li>
<li>200%</li>
<li>2 to 1</li>
<li>2</li>
</ul>
<p>Ratios are extremely useful in drawing the financial position of a concern.</p>
<h2>Accounting Analysis</h2>
<p>Comparative analysis and interpretation of accounting data is called Accounting Analysis. When accounting data is expressed in relation to some other data, it conveys some significant information to the users of data.</p>
<h2>Ratio Analysis and its Applications</h2>
<p>Ratio analysis is a medium to understand the financial weakness and soundness of an organization. Keeping in mind the objective of analysis, the analyst has to select appropriate data to calculate appropriate ratios. Interpretation depends upon the caliber of the analyst.</p>
<p>Ratio analysis is useful in many ways to different concerned parties according to their respective requirements. Ratio analysis can be used in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>To know the financial strength and weakness of an organization.</li>
<li>To measure operative efficiency of a concern.</li>
<li>For the management to review past year’s activity.</li>
<li>To assess level of efficiency.</li>
<li>To predict the future plans of a business.</li>
<li>To optimize capital structure.</li>
<li>In inter and intra company comparisons.</li>
<li>To measure liquidity, solvency, profitability and managerial efficiency of a concern.</li>
<li>In proper utilization of assets of a company.</li>
<li>In budget preparation.</li>
<li>In assessing solvency of a firm, bankruptcy position of a firm, and chances of corporate sickness.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages of Ratio Analysis</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It is powerful tool to measure short and long-term solvency of a company.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a tool to measure profitability and managerial efficiency of a company.</p></li>
<li><p>It is an important tool to measure operating activities of a business.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps in analyzing the capital structure of a company.</p></li>
<li><p>Large quantitative data may be summarized using ratio analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>It relates past accounting performances with the current.</p></li>
<li><p>It is useful in coordinating the different functional machineries of a company.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps the management in future decision-making.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps in maintaining a reasonable balance between sales and purchase and estimating working capital requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations of Ratio Analysis</h2>
<p>Although Ratio Analysis is a very useful accounting tools to analyze and interpret different accounting equations, it comes with its own set of limitations:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If the data received from financial accounting is incorrect, then the information derived from ratio analysis could not be reliable.</p></li>
<li><p>Unauthenticated data may lead to misinterpretation of ratio analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Future prediction may not be always dependable, as ratio analysis is based on the past performance.</p></li>
<li><p>To get a conclusive idea about the business, a series of ratios is to be calculated. A single ratio cannot serve the purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not necessary that a ratio can give the real present situation of a business, as the result is based on historical data.</p></li>
<li><p>Trend analysis is done with the help of various calculated ratios that can be distorted due to the changes in the price level.</p></li>
<li><p>Ratio analysis is effective only where same accounting principles and policies are adopted by other concerns too, otherwise inter-company comparison will not exhibit a real picture at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Through ratio analysis, special events cannot be identified. For example, maturity of debentures cannot be identified with ratio analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>For effective ratio analysis, practical experience and knowledge about particular industry is essential. Otherwise, it may prove worthless.</p></li>
<li><p>Ratio analysis is a useful tool only in the hands of an expert.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Ratio</h2>
<p>Ratios can be classified on the basis of financial statements or on the basis of functional aspects.</p>
<h2>Classification on the Basis of Financial Statement</h2>
<h3>Balance Sheet Ratios</h3>
<p>Ratios calculated from taking various data from the balance sheet are called balance sheet ratio. For example, current ratio, liquid ratio, capital gearing ratio, debt equity ratio, and proprietary ratio, etc.</p>
<h3>Revenue Statement Ratio</h3>
<p>Ratios calculated on the basis of data appearing in the trading account or the profit and loss account are called revenue statement ratios. For example, operating ratio, net profit ratio, gross profit ratio, stock turnover ratio.</p>
<h3>Mixed or Composite Ratio</h3>
<p>When the data from both balance sheet and revenue statements are used, it is called mixed or composite ratio. For example, working capital turnover ratio, inventory turnover ratio, accounts payable turnover ratio, fixed assets turnover ratio, return of net worth ratio, return on investment ratio.</p>

<h2>Classification on the Basis of Financial Aspects</h2>
<p>Ratios can be further classified based on their functional aspects as discussed below.</p>
<h3>Liquidity Ratios</h3>
<p>Liquidity ratios are used to find out the short-term paying capacity of a firm, to comment short term solvency of the firm, or to meet its current liabilities. Similarly, turnover ratios are calculated to know the efficiency of liquid resources of the firm, Accounts Receivable (Debtors) Turnover Ratio and Accounts Payable (Creditors).</p>
<h3>Long-Term Solvency and Leverage Ratios</h3>
<p>Debt equity ratio and interest coverage ratio are calculated to know the efficiency of a firm to pay long-term debts and to meet interest costs. Leverage ratios are calculated to know the proportion of debt and equity in the financing of a firm.</p>
<h3>Activity Ratios</h3>
<p>Activity ratios are also called turnover ratios. Activity ratios measure the efficiency with which the resources of a firm are employed.</p>
<h3>Profitability Ratios</h3>
<p>The results of business operations can be calculated through profitability ratios. These ratios can also be used to know the overall performance and effectiveness of a firm. Two types of profitability ratios are calculated in relation to sales and investments.</p>
