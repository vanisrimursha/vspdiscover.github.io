<h1>E-Commerce - Business Models</h1>

<p>E-commerce business models can generally be categorized into the following categories.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Business - to - Business (B2B)</li>
<li>Business - to - Consumer (B2C)</li>
<li>Consumer - to - Consumer (C2C)</li>
<li>Consumer - to - Business (C2B)</li>
<li>Business - to - Government (B2G)</li>
<li>Government - to - Business (G2B)</li>
<li>Government - to - Citizen (G2C)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Business - to - Business</h2>
<p>A website following the B2B business model sells its products to an intermediate buyer
who then sells the product to the final customer. As an example, a wholesaler places an order from a company's website and after receiving the consignment, sells the endproduct to the final customer who comes to buy the product at one of its retail outlets.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/b2b.jpg" alt="B2B Model" />
<h2>Business - to - Consumer</h2>
<p>A website following the B2C business model sells its products directly to a customer. A
customer can view the products shown on the website. The customer can choose a product and order the same. The website will then send a notification to the business organization via email and the organization will dispatch the product/goods to the customer.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/b2c.jpg" alt="B2C Model" />
<h2>Consumer - to - Consumer</h2>
<p>A website following the C2C business model helps consumers to sell their assets like
residential property, cars, motorcycles, etc., or rent a room by publishing their information on the website. Website may or may not charge the consumer for its services. Another consumer may opt to buy the product of the first customer by viewing the post/advertisement on the website.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/c2c.jpg" alt="C2C Model" />
<h2>Consumer - to - Business</h2>
<p>In this model, a consumer approaches a website showing multiple business organizations
for a particular service. The consumer places an estimate of amount he/she wants to spend for a particular service. For example, the comparison of interest rates of personal loan/car loan provided by various banks via websites. A business organization who fulfills the consumer's requirement within the specified budget, approaches the customer and provides its services.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/c2b.jpg" alt="C2B Model" />
<h2>Business - to - Government</h2>
<p>B2G model is a variant of B2B model. Such websites are used by governments to trade and exchange information with various business organizations. Such websites are accredited by the government and provide a medium to businesses to submit application forms to the government.</p>
<img src="/e_commerce/images/b2g.jpg" alt="B2G Model" />
<h2>Government - to - Business</h2>
<p>Governments use B2G model websites to approach business organizations. Such websites support auctions, tenders, and application submission functionalities.</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/g2b.jpg" alt="G2B Model" />
<h2>Government - to - Citizen</h2>
<p>Governments use G2C model websites to approach citizen in general. Such websites support auctions of vehicles, machinery, or any other material. Such website also provides services like registration for birth, marriage or death certificates. The main objective of G2C websites is to reduce the average time for fulfilling citizen’s requests for various government services.</p>

<h1>E-Commerce - Payment Systems</h1>

<p>E-commerce sites use electronic payment, where electronic payment refers to paperless monetary transactions. Electronic payment has revolutionized the business processing by reducing the paperwork, transaction costs, and labor cost. Being user friendly and less time-consuming than manual processing, it helps business organization to expand its market reach/expansion. Listed below are some of the modes of electronic payments &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Credit Card</li>
<li>Debit Card</li>
<li>Smart Card</li>
<li>E-Money</li>
<li>Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credit Card</h2>
<p>Payment using credit card is one of most common mode of electronic payment. Credit card is small plastic card with a unique number attached with an account. It has also a magnetic strip embedded in it which is used to read credit card via card readers. When a customer purchases a product via credit card, credit card issuer bank pays on behalf of the customer and customer has a certain time period after which he/she can pay the credit card bill. It is usually credit card monthly payment cycle. Following are the actors in the credit card system.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><b>The card holder</b> &minus; Customer</li>
<li><b>The merchant</b> &minus; seller of product who can accept credit card payments.</li>
<li><b>The card issuer bank</b> &minus; card holder's bank</li>
<li><b>The acquirer bank</b> &minus; the merchant's bank</li>
<li><b>The card brand</b> &minus; for example , visa or Mastercard.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credit Card Payment Proces</h2>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="width:20%">Step</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Step 1</td>
<td>Bank issues and activates a credit card to the customer on his/her request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Step 2</td>
<td>The customer presents the credit card information to the merchant site or to the merchant from whom he/she wants to purchase a product/service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Step 3</td>
<td>Merchant validates the customer's identity by asking for approval from the card brand company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Step 4</td>
<td>Card brand company authenticates the credit card and pays the transaction by credit. Merchant keeps the sales slip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Step 5</td>
<td>Merchant submits the sales slip to acquirer banks and gets the service charges paid to him/her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Step 6</td>
<td>Acquirer bank requests the card brand company to clear the credit amount and gets the payment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Step 6</td>
<td>Now the card brand company asks to clear the amount from the issuer bank and the amount gets transferred to the card brand company.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Debit Card</h2>
<p>Debit card, like credit card, is a small plastic card with a unique number mapped with
the bank account number. It is required to have a bank account before getting a debit card from the bank. The major difference between a debit card and a credit card is that in case of payment through debit card, the amount gets deducted from the card's bank account immediately and there should be sufficient balance in the bank account for the transaction to get completed; whereas in case of a credit card transaction, there is no such compulsion.</p>
<p>Debit cards free the customer to carry cash and cheques. Even merchants accept a debit card readily. Having a restriction on the amount that can be withdrawn in a day using a debit card helps the customer to keep a check on his/her spending.</p>
<h2>Smart Card</h2>
<p>Smart card is again similar to a credit card or a debit card in appearance, but it has a
small microprocessor chip embedded in it. It has the capacity to store a customer’s work-related and/or personal information. Smart cards are also used to store money and the amount gets deducted after every transaction.</p>
<p>Smart cards can only be accessed using a PIN that every customer is assigned with. Smart cards are secure, as they store information in encrypted format and are less expensive/provides faster processing. Mondex and Visa Cash cards are examples of smart cards.</p>
<h2>E-Money</h2>
<p>E-Money transactions refer to situation where payment is done over the network and the
amount gets transferred from one financial body to another financial body without any involvement of a middleman. E-money transactions are faster, convenient, and saves a lot of time.</p>
<p>Online payments done via credit cards, debit cards, or smart cards are examples of emoney
transactions. Another popular example is e-cash. In case of e-cash, both customer and merchant have to sign up with the bank or company issuing e-cash.</p>
<h2>Electronic Fund Transfer</h2>
<p>It is a very popular electronic payment method to transfer money from one bank account to another bank account. Accounts can be in the same bank or different banks. Fund transfer can be done using ATM (Automated Teller Machine) or using a computer.</p>
<p>Nowadays, internet-based EFT is getting popular. In this case, a customer uses the website provided by the bank, logs in to the bank's website and registers another bank account. He/she then places a request to transfer certain amount to that account. Customer's bank transfers the amount to other account if it is in the same bank, otherwise the transfer request is forwarded to an ACH (Automated Clearing House) to transfer the amount to other account and the amount is deducted from the customer's account. Once the amount is transferred to other account, the customer is notified of the fund transfer by the bank.</p>
