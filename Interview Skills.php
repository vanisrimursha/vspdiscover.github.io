<h1>Types of Job Interviews</h1>
<p>Great job, your resume has taken you to the next step, the interview process. There are several different types of interviews, but they all serve the same purpose of letting interviewers evaluate your skills, knowledge, experience, education and personality to determine if you’re right for the position. Depending on the type of position you’re applying for, you will most likely go through several types of interviews. Please read all pages in this section to become well informed so you can make your interview process a winning one.</p>
<p>Some companies will have you complete a test as part of the interview process, so be prepared. These tests normally evaluate how you handle certain situations, your level of skills in leadership, customer service and problem solving. They can also test how honest you are with your answers; at times they ask you the same question in several different formats and compare the answers for consistency. Normally these tests are multiple choice questions.</p>
<p>Below is an explanation of some of the different types of interviews that you may face. When you are speaking with the person setting up your interview, it is appropriate to ask whom you will be interviewing with and what their position is. Asking this will give you some insight into the type of interviewer you are up against for your interview.</p>
<h2>Screening and Phone Interviews</h2>
<p>These are usually the first steps in the interview process and are normally quick and take place over the phone. This first interview is extremely important as it will decide if you go on to further interviews. Normally performed by a member of the human resources department, these interviews use direct questions to find out if you would fit the company&#8217;s culture and have the knowledge, experience and qualifications for the position. Providing facts about your skills and experience is more important than establishing rapport.</p>
<p>When searching for a job you need to start answering your phone with high energy and in a professional manner in case you get one of these calls. It is not recommended to take a phone interview on the fly if you’re not prepared, you can communicate to the interviewer that you are currently not in a private location to perform a phone interview and arrange for a set time: it can even be later that same day. You need to choose a place that is quiet from any background noise, well lit and at a comfortable temperature. Be prepared with your resume in-front of you, a pad and pen to take notes. Prior to the interview research, the company and the actual job requirements and make a list of how you can bring value to their organization. Highlight areas of your resume that you feel are relevant to this position and company. Make sure you are free from all distractions, don&#8217;t multitask and pay attention to the questions during the interview. The interviewer might ask about your salary requirements and salary history, share accurate information to avoid wasting anyone&#8217;s time, but don’t lock yourself into a figure, give a range or explain you need to learn more about the position and total compensation before providing a salary requirement.  If they don&#8217;t ask about salary it&#8217;s recommended not to bring it up at this part in the interview process.</p>
<h2>One-On-One Interviews / Face-To-Face Interviews</h2>
<p>This is the interview that most are familiar with and normally takes place after a phone screening interview. It is normally established that you have the requirements for the position from your resume and screening interview. The interviewer wants to see how you will fit into the company and will ask questions to test your listed skills and experience. Please make sure that you focus on the questions, don&#8217;t go off on a rant and keep your answers short and to the point. Your goal is to build a rapport with the interviewer and market you to them and how you can contribute to their organization.</p>
<h2>Multiple Interviews</h2>
<p>It is very common that you will go through several levels of interviews, on average most candidates are interviewed by 3 different individuals and it is not unusual to be interviewed up to 5 times; these can take place on the same day or over several weeks. The larger the company the more interviews you can expect and it can be a combination of one-on-one, group and panel interviews. Small and private companies might only take as little as one interview.</p>
<h2>Candidate Group Interviews</h2>
<p>These interviews set two or more applicants against each other as you all will be interviewed at the same time and most likely there are two or more interviewers. All applicants will be applying for the same position. These interviews test your style, professionalism, leadership skills and the ability to function in a group under pressure. You will be judged on your answers, and how you interact and handle yourself in a group of peers and in stressful situations. Don&#8217;t get stressed out during this interview, you are among the cream of the crop, now you just need to shine above the other candidates.</p>
<h2>Panel or Committee Interviews</h2>
<p>This is when several members of the company who have a say whether you will be hired interview you at that same time. Sometimes this is performed as a time saver method or as a way to see how you deal under more pressures than a traditional interview. You need to make sure that you address each interviewer so that you can connect with them as individuals. Shake hands with each person and repeat their names during the introduction; maintain eye contact with the panel member who is asking the current question but as you give your answers seek eye contact with all the members. When you are asking questions, ensure you engage with all members of the panel and not just one individual, even when addressing only one the interviewers. This type of interview can put more pressure on you, and you need to stay calm and collected.</p>
<h2>Breakfast or Lunch Interviews</h2>
<p>Some managers like to interview outside the office setting and get an insight on how you behave in more relax surroundings. You need to maintain the same standards during these types of interviews as you would interview in an office setting. The environment might be more casual, but you’re still being closely monitored. Use this type of interview to build common ground with the interviewer and follow their lead with menu choices and etiquette, but don&#8217;t order selections you won&#8217;t eat or drink. Do not order the most expensive items and never consume alcohol beverages during these interviews. Be aware of your table manners and never speak with your mouth full. This sounds like common sense tips, but many don&#8217;t follow them.</p>
<h2>Teleconferencing / Web Conferencing Interviews</h2>
<p>Many times you are interviewing for a company where their corporate office is a distance away, as a way to save on travel expenses many companies are utilizing the newest process of interviewing using a webcam online format. Technology has made this a very viable method; you may be doing this interview from your home or at one of the company’s remote locations. It can&#8217;t be emphasize enough that you treat this interview in the same exact manner as a face-to-face interview, from your attire to your professionalism; remember they can still see you and read your expressions. If you are taking this interview in your home ensure your cam viewed environment is organized and neat, and there are no background noises to distract you. Turn off your house and cell phones and close your windows so outside noise is kept out. If other family members are around the home, ask them to step outside if possible and have them take the family dog with them, a barking dog can distract the interview.</p>
<h2>Behavioral Interviews</h2>
<p>This method can take place during any of the above interview types, and it’s a test as to how well you have handled certain stressful situations in your past. With behavioral interviews,  the interviewer is examining for behavior patterns rather than correct answers they probe into what you have done in the past, not what you say you will do in the future. It’s predicted that your will repeat your past performance in the future. You will be asked a series of questions on how you handled various different situations from your past that are relevant to the position you’re interviewing. Review your resume to come up with a list of challenges and issues you were faced with and how you conquered them. These questions normally start out with “tell me about a time when…” or “give me an example of how you….” Example</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6>Tell me the time when your boss told you to do something you knew was wrong and how you handled it?</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Give me an example of how you dealt with and completely unreasonable client/customer?</h6>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stress Interviews</h2>
<p>These types of interviews are performed to see how you react to unexpected situations and pressures. The interviewer can be   sarcastic, argumentative and rude with you; he/she might make you wait a while before they perform the interview. They will even leave long pauses between questions. All this is their attempt to unnerve you and evaluate how you act under this type of pressure. Ideally you will show them what you are made of by keeping your cool; the more pressure they apply the calmer you need to become.</p>

<h1>Preparing for Interviews</h1>
<p>In interviews, your job is to convince a recruiter that you have the skills, knowledge and experience for the job. Show motivation and convince a recruiter that you fit the organization's culture and job description, and you get that much closer to an offer. </p>
<h2>7-Step Interview Prep Plan</h2>
<h3>1. Research the organization.</h3>
<p>This will help you answer questions — and stand out from less-prepared candidates.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Seek background information.</strong> 
<ul><li>Use tools like Vault, CareerSearch or The Riley Guide for an overview of the organization and its industry profile.</li>
<li>Visit the organization’s website to ensure that you understand the breadth of what they do.</li>
<li>Review the organization's background and mission statement.</li>
<li>Assess their products, services and client-base.</li>
<li>Read recent press releases for insight on projected growth and stability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Get perspective.</strong> Review trade or business publications. Seek perspective and a glimpse into their industry standing.</li>
<li><strong>Develop a question list.</strong> Prepare to ask about the organization or position based on your research.</li>
</ul><h3>2. Compare your skills and qualifications to the job requirements.</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Analyze the job description.</strong> Outline the knowledge, skills and abilities required.</li>
<li><strong>Examine the hierarchy.</strong> Determine where the position fits within the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Look side-by-side.</strong> Compare what the employer is seeking to your qualifications.</li>
</ul><h3>3. Prepare responses.</h3>
<p>Most interviews involve a combination of resume-based, behavioral and case questions. We encourage you to meet with us to practice telling your story in the best possible way.</p>
<h3>4. Plan what to wear.</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Go neutral.</strong> Conservative business attire, such as a neutral-colored suit and professional shoes, is best.</li>
<li><strong>Err formal.</strong> If instructed to dress “business casual,” use good judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Plug in that iron.</strong> Make sure your clothes are neat and wrinkle-free.</li>
<li><strong>Dress to impress.</strong> Be sure that your overall appearance is neat and clean.</li>
</ul><h3>5. Plan what to bring.</h3>
<ul><li>Extra copies of your resume on quality paper</li>
<li>A notepad or professional binder and pen</li>
<li>A list of references</li>
<li>Information you might need to complete an application</li>
<li>A portfolio with samples of your work, if relevant</li>
</ul><h3>6. Pay attention to non-verbal communication.</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Be mindful. </strong>Nonverbal communication speaks volumes. </li>
<li><strong>Start ahead.</strong> Remember that waiting room behaviors may be reported.</li>
<li><strong>Project confidence.</strong> Smile, establish eye contact and use a firm handshake.</li>
<li><strong>Posture counts.</strong> Sit up straight yet comfortably. Be aware of nervous gestures such as foot-tapping.</li>
<li><strong>Be attentive.</strong>  Don't stare, but maintain good eye contact, while addressing all aspects of an interviewer's questions.</li>
<li><strong>Respect their space.</strong> Do not place anything on their desk.</li>
<li><strong>Manage reactions.</strong> Facial expressions provide clues to your feelings. Manage how you react, and project a positive image.</li>
</ul><h3>7. Follow up.</h3>
<p>Many interviews end with “Do you have any questions?” </p>
<ul><li><strong>Bring a list.</strong> You may say, “In preparing for today's meeting, I took some time to jot down a few questions. Please allow me to review my notes.” </li>
<li><strong>Be strategic.</strong> Cover information not discussed or clarify a previous topic — do not ask for information that can be found on the organization’s website.</li>
<ul><li>In your opinion, what makes this organization a great place to work?</li>
<li>What do you consider the most important criteria for success in this job?</li>
<li>Tell me about the organization’s culture.</li>
<li>How will my performance be evaluated?</li>
<li>What are the opportunities for advancement?</li>
<li>What are the next steps in the hiring process?</li>
</ul></ul>

<h1>What to do in interview ?</h1>
<p>1) Dressing the Part </p>

<p>In order to impress the company you're interviewing with, you must dress accordingly. Wearing business attire, suites, a nice dress, or a pantsuit if you're a girl, you want to avoid dressing in your normal day clothes, including yoga pants. </p>

<p>Always wear the appropriate attire, and make sure to wear professional business attire as well as to practice good hygiene and present yourself like you want the company to see you.</p>



      
<p>2) Review the Questions The Interviewers Will Ask You </p>

<p>Make sure to prepare a list of questions that could possibly be asked by the interviewer. You can practice your interviewing skills with a friend, or you could sign up for an interview with Interviewstream through the Pomerantz Career Center. The Interviewstream will ask questions assimilated with actual professional interviews, and you will get to see the feedback from your interview. All you need is a camera, or you can even schedule an interview in the interview stream room at the Pomerantz Career Center! </p>

<p>3) Do Enough Research on the Company</p>

<p>Review the website for the company you're applying for and make sure to write down facts you find interesting and questions you want answered by the interviewer in the company. </p>

<p>4) Be Respectful of the Interviewers </p>

<p>Give the utmost respect for interviewers that are conducting the interview and asking you the questions. The people are always writing notes about your answers and your behavior. This is their first impression of you besides what's on your resume, you want to make sure leave a lasting positive impression to the company! </p>

<p>5) Good Non-Verbal Behavior </p>

<p>-Keep eye contact with the interviewer during the interviewer </p>

<p>- Make sure to always sit upright and be open with your body posture </p>

<p>-Look interested in all the questions the interviewer is asking you </p>

<p>6) Be On Time to the Interivew</p>

<p>Make sure to arrive at least 10 minutes early to the Interview. The company will appreciate timeliness and being prompt. It will also give you a chance to go over what your responses to the questions are as well as to make sure you look good and feel good! </p>

<p>7) Know all the Credentials of the Company and the Job you're Applying For</p>

<p>Make sure to know all of the aspects and qualifications of the job you're applying for. You want to bring up any qualifications you have regarding what you think you can bring to the table for the company in the interview. </p>

<p>8) Bring Extra Resumes</p>

<p>Make sure to bring extra resumes to the interview just in case the company needs another copy. If you also have a portfolio, you can bring that as well to showcase some of your previous work and achievements. </p>

<p>9) Speak with Energy and Provide True Details</p>

<p>Make sure to always have a lot of positive energy and only provide true details about your previous employment or achievements. DO NOT LIE about anything in your interview. A company won't want to hire someone on false information. </p>

<p>10) Writing Thank You Letters Immediately After the Interview</p>

<p>Make sure to thank your interviewers for their time and consideration in reviewing them for the job opportunity. Make sure to follow up with the interviewers and the company as well after you finish your interview. </p>

<p>By following these tips, you'll rock your interview and make sure to wow the company and hopefully seal the deal and get a job! </p>

<p>To help with the interview process, keep the following ten rules in mind:</p>
<table style="width: 100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="4%">
<p class="style12" align="center">1</p>
</td>
<td width="96%"><strong>Keep your answers brief and concise.</strong> Unless asked to give more detail, limit your answers to two to three minutes per question. Tape yourself and see how long it takes you to fully answer a question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="style12" align="center">2</p>
</td>
<td><strong>Include concrete, quantifiable data.</strong> Interviewees tend to talk in generalities. Unfortunately, generalities often fail to convince interviewers that the applicant has assets. Include measurable information and provide details about specific accomplishments when discussing your strengths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="style12" align="center">3</p>
</td>
<td><strong>Repeat your key strengths three times.</strong> It’s essential that you comfortably and confidently articulate your strengths. Explain how the strengths relate to the company’s or department’s goals and how they might benefit the potential employer. If you repeat your strengths then they will be remembered and—if supported with quantifiable accomplishments—they will more likely be believed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="style12" align="center">4</p>
</td>
<td><strong>Prepare five or more success stories.</strong> In preparing for interviews, make a list of your skills and key assets. Then reflect on past jobs and pick out one or two instances when you used those skills successfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="style12" align="center">5</p>
</td>
<td><strong>Put yourself on their team. </strong>Ally yourself with the prospective employer by using the employer’s name and products or services. For example, “As a member of __________, I would carefully analyze the __________ and __________.” Show that you are thinking like a member of the team and will fit in with the existing environment. Be careful though not to say anything that would offend or be taken negatively. Your research will help you in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="style12" align="center">6</p>
</td>
<td><strong>Image is often as important as content.</strong> What you look like and how you say something are just as important as what you say. Studies have shown that 65 percent of the conveyed message is nonverbal; gestures, physical appearance and attire are highly influential during job interviews.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="style12" align="center">7</p>
</td>
<td><strong>Ask questions. </strong>The types of questions you ask and the way you ask them can make a tremendous impression on the interviewer. Good questions require advance preparation. Just as you plan how you would answer an interviewer’s questions, write out specific questions you want to ask. Then look for opportunities to ask them during the interview. Don’t ask about benefits or salary. The interview process is a two-way street whereby you and the interviewer assess each other to determine if there is an appropriate match.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="style12" align="center">8</p>
</td>
<td><strong>Maintain a conversational flow. </strong>By consciously maintaining a conversational flow—a dialogue instead of a monologue—you will be perceived more positively. Use feedback questions at the end of your answers and use body language and voice intonation to create a conversational interchange between you and the interviewer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="style12" align="center">9</p>
</td>
<td><strong>Research the company, product lines and competitors.</strong> Research will provide information to help you decide whether you’re interested in the company and important data to refer to during the interview.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="style12" align="center">10</p>
</td>
<td><strong>Keep an interview journal.</strong> As soon as possible, write a brief summary of what happened. Note any follow-up action you should take and put it in your calendar. Review your presentation. Keep a journal of your attitude and the way you answered the questions. Did you ask questions to get the information you needed? What might you do differently next time? Prepare and send a brief, concise thank-you letter. Restate your skills and stress what you can do for the company.</td>

<h1>Interview Questions with Answer</h1>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if you knew exactly what a hiring manager would be asking you in your next job interview?</p>
<p>While we unfortunately can't read minds, we'll give you the next best thing: a list of the 31 most commonly asked interview questions and answers. </p>
<p>While we don't recommend having a canned response for every interview question (in fact, please don't), we do recommend spending some time getting comfortable with what you might be asked, what hiring managers are really looking for in your responses, and what it takes to show that you're the right man or woman for the job.</p>
<p>Consider this list your interview question study guide. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>1. Can you tell me a little about yourself?</h2>
<p>This question seems simple, so many people fail to prepare for it, but it's crucial. Here's the deal: Don't give your complete employment (or personal) history. Instead give a pitch—one that’s concise and compelling and that shows exactly why you’re the right fit for the job. Start off with the 2-3 specific accomplishments or experiences that you most want the interviewer to know about, then wrap up talking about how that prior experience has positioned you for this specific role.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>2. How did you hear about the position?</h2>
<p>Another seemingly innocuous interview question, this is actually a perfect opportunity to stand out and show your passion for and connection to the company. For example, if you found out about the gig through a friend or professional contact, name drop that person, then share why you were so excited about it. If you discovered the company through an event or article, share that. Even if you found the listing through a random job board, share what, specifically, caught your eye about the role.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>3. What do you know about the company?</h2>
<p>Any candidate can read and regurgitate the company’s “About” page. So, when interviewers ask this, they aren't necessarily trying to gauge whether you understand the mission—they want to know whether you care about it. Start with one line that shows you understand the company's goals, using a couple key words and phrases from the website, but then go on to make it personal. Say, “I’m personally drawn to this mission because…” or “I really believe in this approach because…” and share a personal example or two. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>4. Why do you want this job?</h2>
<p>Again, companies want to hire people who are passionate about the job, so you should have a great answer about why you want the position. (And if you don't? You probably should apply elsewhere.) First, identify a couple of key factors that make the role a great fit for you (e.g., “I love customer support because I love the constant human interaction and the satisfaction that comes from helping someone solve a problem"), then share why you love the company (e.g., “I’ve always been passionate about education, and I think you guys are doing great things, so I want to be a part of it”). </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>5. Why should we hire you?</h2>
<p>This interview question seems forward (not to mention intimidating!), but if you're asked it, you're in luck: There's no better setup for you to sell yourself and your skills to the hiring manager. Your job here is to craft an answer that covers three things: that you can not only do the work, you can deliver great results; that you'll really fit in with the team and culture; and that you'd be a better hire than any of the other candidates. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>6. What are your greatest professional strengths?</h2>
<p>When answering this question, interview coach Pamela Skillings recommends being accurate (share your true strengths, not those you think the interviewer wants to hear); relevant (choose your strengths that are most targeted to this particular position); and specific (for example, instead of “people skills,” choose “persuasive communication” or “relationship building”). Then, follow up with an example of how you've demonstrated these traits in a professional setting.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>7. What do you consider to be your weaknesses?</h2>
<p>What your interviewer is really trying to do with this question—beyond identifying any major red flags—is to gauge your self-awareness and honesty. So, “I can't meet a deadline to save my life” is not an option—but neither is “Nothing! I'm perfect!” Strike a balance by thinking of something that you struggle with but that you’re working to improve. For example, maybe you’ve never been strong at public speaking, but you've recently volunteered to run meetings to help you be more comfortable when addressing a crowd. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>8. What is your greatest professional achievement?</h2>
<p>Nothing says “hire me” better than a track record of achieving amazing results in past jobs, so don't be shy when answering this interview question! A great way to do so is by using the S-T-A-R method: Set up the situation and the task that you were required to complete to provide the interviewer with background context (e.g., “In my last job as a junior analyst, it was my role to manage the invoicing process”), but spend the bulk of your time describing what you actually did (the action) and what you achieved (the result). For example, “In one month, I streamlined the process, which saved my group 10 man-hours each month and reduced errors on invoices by 25%.” </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>9. Tell me about a challenge or conflict you've faced at work, and how you dealt with it.</h2>
<p>In asking this interview question, “your interviewer wants to get a sense of how you will respond to conflict. Anyone can seem nice and pleasant in a job interview, but what will happen if you’re hired and Gladys in Compliance starts getting in your face?” says Skillings. Again, you'll want to use the S-T-A-R method, being sure to focus on how you handled the situation professionally and productively, and ideally closing with a happy ending, like how you came to a resolution or compromise. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>10. Where do you see yourself in five years?</h2>
<p>If asked this question, be honest and specific about your future goals, but consider this: A hiring manager wants to know a) if you've set realistic expectations for your career, b) if you have ambition (a.k.a., this interview isn't the first time you're considering the question), and c) if the position aligns with your goals and growth. Your best bet is to think realistically about where this position could take you and answer along those lines. And if the position isn’t necessarily a one-way ticket to your aspirations? It’s OK to say that you’re not quite sure what the future holds, but that you see this experience playing an important role in helping you make that decision.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>11. What's your dream job?</h2>
<p>Along similar lines, the interviewer wants to uncover whether this position is really in line with your ultimate career goals. While “an NBA star” might get you a few laughs, a better bet is to talk about your goals and ambitions—and why this job will get you closer to them. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>12. What other companies are you interviewing with?</h2>
<p>Companies ask this for a number of reasons, from wanting to see what the competition is for you to sniffing out whether you're serious about the industry. “Often the best approach is to mention that you are exploring a number of other similar options in the company's industry,” says job search expert Alison Doyle. “It can be helpful to mention that a common characteristic of all the jobs you are applying to is the opportunity to apply some critical abilities and skills that you possess. For example, you might say 'I am applying for several positions with IT consulting firms where I can analyze client needs and translate them to development teams in order to find solutions to technology problems.'”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>13. Why are you leaving your current job?</h2>
<p>This is a toughie, but one you can be sure you'll be asked. Definitely keep things positive—you have nothing to gain by being negative about your past employers. Instead, frame things in a way that shows that you're eager to take on new opportunities and that the role you’re interviewing for is a better fit for you than your current or last position. For example, “I’d really love to be part of product development from beginning to end, and I know I’d have that opportunity here.” And if you were let go? Keep it simple: “Unfortunately, I was let go,” is a totally OK answer. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>14. Why were you fired?</h2>
<p>OK, if you get the admittedly much tougher follow-up question as to <em>why</em> you were let go (and the truth isn't exactly pretty), your best bet is to be honest (the job-seeking world is small, after all). But it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker. Share how you’ve grown and how you approach your job and life now as a result. If you can position the learning experience as an advantage for this next job, even better.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>15. What are you looking for in a new position?</h2>
<p>Hint: Ideally the same things that this position has to offer. Be specific.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>16. What type of work environment do you prefer?</h2>
<p>Hint: Ideally one that's similar to the environment of the company you're applying to. Be specific. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>17. What's your management style?</h2>
<p>The best managers are strong but flexible, and that's exactly what you want to show off in your answer. (Think something like, “While every situation and every team member requires a bit of a different strategy, I tend to approach my employee relationships as a coach...”) Then, share a couple of your best managerial moments, like when you grew your team from five to 15 or coached an underperforming employee to become the company's top salesperson. </p>
<h2>18. What's a time you exercised leadership?</h2>
<p>Depending on what's more important for the the role, you'll want to choose an example that showcases your project management skills (spearheading a project from end to end, juggling multiple moving parts) or one that shows your ability to confidently and effectively rally a team. And remember: “The best stories include enough detail to be believable and memorable,” says Skillings. “Show how you were a leader in this situation and how it represents your overall leadership experience and potential.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>19. What's a time you disagreed with a decision that was made at work?</h2>
<p>Everyone disagrees with the boss from time to time, but in asking this interview question, hiring managers want to know that you can do so in a productive, professional way. “You don’t want to tell the story about the time when you disagreed but your boss was being a jerk and you just gave in to keep the peace. And you don’t want to tell the one where you realized you were wrong,” says Peggy McKee of Career Confidential. “Tell the one where your actions made a positive difference on the outcome of the situation, whether it was a work-related outcome or a more effective and productive working relationship.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>20. How would your boss and co-workers describe you?</h2>
<p>First of all, be honest (remember, if you get this job, the hiring manager will be calling your former bosses and co-workers!). Then, try to pull out strengths and traits you haven't discussed in other aspects of the interview, such as your strong work ethic or your willingness to pitch in on other projects when needed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>21. Why was there a gap in your employment?</h2>
<p>If you were unemployed for a period of time, be direct and to the point about what you’ve been up to (and hopefully, that’s a litany of impressive volunteer and other mind-enriching activities, like blogging or taking classes). Then, steer the conversation toward how you will do the job and contribute to the organization: “I decided to take a break at the time, but today I’m ready to contribute to this organization in the following ways.” </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>22. Can you explain why you changed career paths?</h2>
<p>Don't be thrown off by this question—just take a deep breath and explain to the hiring manager why you've made the career decisions you have. More importantly, give a few examples of how your past experience is transferrable to the new role. This doesn't have to be a direct connection; in fact, it's often more impressive when a candidate can make seemingly irrelevant experience seem very relevant to the role. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>23. How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?</h2>
<p>"Choose an answer that shows that you can meet a stressful situation head-on in a productive, positive manner and let nothing stop you from accomplishing your goals," says McKee. A great approach is to talk through your go-to stress-reduction tactics (making the world's greatest to-do list, stopping to take 10 deep breaths), and then share an example of a stressful situation you navigated with ease.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>24. What would your first 30, 60, or 90 days look like in this role?</h2>
<p>Start by explaining what you'd need to do to get ramped up. What information would you need? What parts of the company would you need to familiarize yourself with? What other employees would you want to sit down with? Next, choose a couple of areas where you think you can make meaningful contributions right away. (e.g., “I think a great starter project would be diving into your email marketing campaigns and setting up a tracking system for them.”) Sure, if you get the job, you (or your new employer) might decide there’s a better starting place, but having an answer prepared will show the interviewer where you can add immediate impact—and that you’re excited to get started.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>25. What are your salary requirements?</h2>
<p>The #1 rule of answering this question is doing your research on what you should be paid by using sites like Payscale and Glassdoor. You’ll likely come up with a range, and we recommend stating the highest number in that range that applies, based on your experience, education, and skills. Then, make sure the hiring manager knows that you're flexible. You're communicating that you know your skills are valuable, but that you want the job and are willing to negotiate.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>26. What do you like to do outside of work?</h2>
<p>Interviewers ask personal questions in an interview to “see if candidates will fit in with the culture [and] give them the opportunity to open up and display their personality, too,” says longtime hiring manager Mitch Fortner. “In other words, if someone asks about your hobbies outside of work, it’s totally OK to open up and share what really makes you tick. (Do keep it semi-professional, though: Saying you like to have a few beers at the local hot spot on Saturday night is fine. Telling them that Monday is usually a rough day for you because you’re always hungover is not.)”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>27. If you were an animal, which one would you want to be?</h2>
<p>Seemingly random personality-test type questions like these come up in interviews generally because hiring managers want to see how you can think on your feet. There's no wrong answer here, but you'll immediately gain bonus points if your answer helps you share your strengths or personality or connect with the hiring manager. Pro tip: Come up with a stalling tactic to buy yourself some thinking time, such as saying, “Now, that is a great question. I think I would have to say… ” </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>28. How many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?</h2>
<p>1,000? 10,000? 100,000? Seriously? </p>
<p>Well, seriously, you might get asked brainteaser questions like these, especially in quantitative jobs. But remember that the interviewer doesn’t necessarily want an exact number—he wants to make sure that you understand what’s being asked of you, and that you can set into motion a systematic and logical way to respond. So, just take a deep breath, and start thinking through the math. (Yes, it’s OK to ask for a pen and paper!)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>29. Are you planning on having children?</h2>
<p>Questions about your family status, gender (“How would you handle managing a team of all men?”), nationality (“Where were you born?”), religion, or age, are illegal—but they still get asked (and frequently). Of course, not always with ill intent—the interviewer might just be trying to make conversation—but you should definitely tie any questions about your personal life (or anything else you think might be inappropriate) back to the job at hand. For this question, think: “You know, I’m not quite there yet. But I am very interested in the career paths at your company. Can you tell me more about that?” </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>30. What do you think we could do better or differently?</h2>
<p>This is a common one at startups (and one of our personal favorites here at The Muse). Hiring managers want to know that you not only have some background on the company, but that you're able to think critically about it and come to the table with new ideas. So, come with new ideas! What new features would you love to see? How could the company increase conversions? How could customer service be improved? You don’t need to have the company’s four-year strategy figured out, but do share your thoughts, and more importantly, show how your interests and expertise would lend themselves to the job. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>31. Do you have any questions for us?</h2>
<p>You probably already know that an interview isn't just a chance for a hiring manager to grill you—it's your opportunity to sniff out whether a job is the right fit for you. What do you want to know about the position? The company? The department? The team? </p>
<p>You'll cover a lot of this in the actual interview, so have a few less-common questions ready to go. We especially like questions targeted to the interviewer (“What's your favorite part about working here?") or the company's growth (“What can you tell me about your new products or plans for growth?")</p>
