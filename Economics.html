<h1>Managerial Economics Overview</h1>

<p>A close interrelationship between management and economics had led to the development of managerial economics. Economic analysis is required for various concepts such as demand, profit, cost, and competition. In this way, managerial economics is considered as economics applied to “problems of choice’’ or alternatives and allocation of scarce resources by the firms.</p>
<p>Managerial economics is a discipline that combines economic theory with managerial practice. It helps in covering the gap between the problems of logic and the problems of policy. The subject offers powerful tools and techniques for managerial policy making.</p>
<h2>Managerial Economics &minus; Definition</h2>
<p>To quote Mansfield, “Managerial economics is concerned with the application of economic concepts and economic analysis to the problems of formulating rational managerial decisions.</p>
<p>Spencer and Siegelman have defined the subject as “the integration of economic theory with business practice for the purpose of facilitating decision making and forward planning by management.”</p>
<h2>Micro, Macro, and Managerial Economics Relationship</h2>
<p><b>Microeconomics</b> studies the actions of individual consumers and firms; <b>managerial economics</b> is an applied specialty of this branch. <b>Macroeconomics</b> deals with the performance, structure, and behavior of an economy as a whole. Managerial economics applies microeconomic theories and techniques to management decisions. It is more limited in scope as compared to microeconomics. Macroeconomists study aggregate indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates to understand the functions of the whole economy.</p>
<p>Microeconomics and managerial economics both encourage the use of quantitative methods to analyze economic data. Businesses have finite human and financial resources; managerial economic principles can aid management decisions in allocating these resources efficiently. Macroeconomics models and their estimates are used by the government to assist in the development of economic policy.</p>
<h2>Nature and Scope of Managerial Economics</h2>
<p>The most important function in managerial economics is decision-making. It involves the complete course of selecting the most suitable action from two or more alternatives. The primary function is to make the most profitable use of resources which are limited such as labor, capital, land etc. A manager is very careful while taking decisions as the future is uncertain; he ensures that the best possible plans are made in the most effective manner to achieve the desired objective which is profit maximization.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Economic theory and economic analysis are used to solve the problems of managerial economics.</p></li>
<li><p>Economics basically comprises of two main divisions namely Micro economics and Macro economics. </p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Managerial economics covers both macroeconomics as well as microeconomics, as both are equally important for decision making and business analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Macroeconomics deals with the study of entire economy. It considers all the factors such as government policies, business cycles, national income, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Microeconomics includes the analysis of small individual units of economy such as individual firms, individual industry, or a single individual consumer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All the economic theories, tools, and concepts are covered under the scope of managerial economics to analyze the business environment. The scope of managerial economics is a continual process, as it is a developing science. Demand analysis and forecasting, profit management, and capital management are also
considered under the scope of managerial economics.</p>
<h3>Demand Analysis and Forecasting</h3>
<p>Demand analysis and forecasting involves huge amount of decision-making! Demand estimation is an integral part of decision making, an assessment of future sales helps in strengthening the market position and maximizing profit. In managerial economics, demand analysis and forecasting holds a very important place.</p>
<h3>Profit Management</h3>
<p>Success of a firm depends on its primary measure and that is profit. Firms are operated to earn long term profit which is generally the reward for risk taking. Appropriate planning and measuring profit is the most important and challenging area of managerial economics.</p>
<h3>Capital Management</h3>
<p>Capital management involves planning and controlling of expenses. There are many problems related to capital investments which involve considerable amount of time and labor. Cost of capital and rate of return are important factors of capital management.</p>
<h3>Demand for Managerial Economics</h3>
<p>The demand for this subject has increased post liberalization and globalization period primarily because of increasing use of economic logic, concepts, tools and theories in the decision making process of large multinationals.</p>
<p>Also, this can be attributed to increasing demand for professionally trained management personnel, who can leverage limited resources available to them and maximize returns with efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<h2>Role in Managerial Decision Making</h2>
<p>Managerial economics leverages economic concepts and decision science techniques to solve managerial problems. It provides optimal solutions to managerial decision making issues.</p>

<h1>Business Firms &amp; Decisions</h1>

<p>Business firms are a combination of manpower, financial, and physical resources which help in making managerial decisions. Societies can be classified into two main categories &minus; production and consumption. Firms are the economic entities and are on the production side, whereas consumers are on the consumption side.</p>
<p>The performances of firms get analyzed in the framework of an economic model. The economic model of a firm is called the theory of the firm. Business decisions include many vital decisions like whether a firm should undertake research and
development program, should a company launch a new product, etc.</p>
<p>Business decisions made by the managers are very important for the success and failure of a firm. Complexity in the business world continuously grows making the role of a manager or a decision maker of an organisation more challenging! The
impact of goods production, marketing, and technological changes highly contribute to the complexity of the business environment.</p>
<h2>Steps for Decision-Making</h2>
<p>The steps for decision making like problem description, objective determination, discovering alternatives, forecasting consequences are described below &minus;</p>
<img src="/C:\Users\vit\Documents\subjects\completed/business_decision_making_steps.jpg" alt="Business Decision Making Steps" />
<h3>Define the Problem</h3>
<p>What is the problem and how does it influence managerial objectives are the main questions. Decisions are usually made in the firm’s planning process. Managerial decisions are at times not very well defined and thus are sometimes source of a problem.</p>
<h3>Determine the Objective</h3>
<p>The goal of an organization or decision maker is very important. In practice, there may be many problems while setting the objectives of a firm related to profit maximization and benefit cost analysis. Are the future benefits worth the present capital? Should a firm make an investment for higher profits for over 8 to 10 years? These are the questions asked before determining the objectives of a firm.</p>
<h3>Discover the Alternatives</h3>
<p>For a sound decision framework, there are many questions which are needed to be answered such as &minus; What are the alternatives? What factors are under the decision maker’s control? What variables constrain the choice of options? The manager needs to carefully formulate all such questions in order to weigh the attractive alternatives.</p>
<h3>Forecast the Consequences</h3>
<p>Forecasting or predicting the consequences of each alternative should be considered. Conditions could change by applying each alternative action so it is crucial to decide which alternative action to use when outcomes are uncertain.</p>
<h3>Make a Choice</h3>
<p>Once all the analysis and scrutinizing is completed, the preferred course of action is selected. This step of the process is said to occupy the lion’s share in analysis. In this step, the objectives and outcomes are directly quantifiable. It all depends on how the decision maker puts the problem, how he formalizes the objectives, considers the appropriate alternatives, and finds out the most preferable course of action.</p>
<h2>Sensitivity Analysis</h2>
<p>Sensitivity analysis helps us in determining the strong features of the optimal choice of action. It helps us to know how the optimal decision changes, if conditions related to the solution are altered. Thus, it proves that the optimal solution chosen should be based on the objective and well structured. Sensitivity analysis reflects how an optimal solution is affected, if the important factors vary or are altered.</p>
<p>Managerial economics is competent enough for serving the purposes in decision making. It focuses on the theory of the firm which considers profit maximization as the main objective. The theory of the firm was developed in the nineteenth century by French and English economists. Theory of the firm emphasizes on optimum utilization of resources, cost control, and profits in a single time period. Theory of the firm approach, with its focus on optimization, is relevant for small farms and producers.</p>

<div id="c3" class="tabcontent">
<h1>Economic Analysis &amp; Optimizations</h1>

<p>Economic analysis is the most crucial phase in managerial economics. A manager has to collect and study the economic data of the environment in which a firm operates. He has to conduct a detailed statistical analysis in order to do research on industrial markets. The research may comprise of information regarding tax rates, products, competitor’s pricing strategies, etc., which may be useful for managerial decision-making.</p>
<p>Optimization techniques are very crucial activities in managerial decision-making process. According to the objective of the firm, the manager tries to make the most effective decision out of all the alternatives available. Though the optimal decisions differ from company to company, the objective of optimization technique is to obtain a condition under which the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost.</p>
<p>The first step in presenting optimization techniques is to examine the methods to express economic relationship. Now let’s have a look at the methods of expressing economic relationship &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Equations, graphs, and tables are extensively used for expressing economic relationships.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphs and tables are used for simple relationships and equations are used for complex relationships.</p></li>
<li><p>Expressing relationships through equations is very useful in economics as it allows the usage of powerful differential technique, in order to determine the optimal solution of the problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now suppose, we have total revenue equation &minus;</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>TR = 100Q &minus; 10Q<sup>2</sup></b></p>
<p>Substituting values for quantity sold, we generate the total revenue schedule of the firm &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">100Q &minus; 10Q<sup>2</sup></th>
<th style="text-align:center;">TR</th>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>100(0) &minus; 10(0)<sup>2</sup></td>
<td>$0</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>100(1) &minus; 10(1)<sup>2</sup></td>
<td>$90</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>100(2) &minus; 10(2)<sup>2</sup></td>
<td>$160</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>100(3) &minus; 10(3)<sup>2</sup></td>
<td>$210</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>100(4) &minus; 10(4)<sup>2</sup></td>
<td>$240</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>100(5) &minus; 10(5)<sup>2</sup></td>
<td>$250</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>100(6) &minus; 10(6)<sup>2</sup></td>
<td>$240</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Relationship between total, marginal, average concepts, and measures is really crucial in managerial economics. Total cost comprises of total fixed cost plus total variable cost or average cost multiply by total number of units produced</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>TC = TFC &plus; TVC or TC = AC.Q</b></p>
<p>Marginal cost is the change in total cost resulting from one unit change in output. Average cost shows per unit cost of production, or total cost divided by number of units produced.</p>
<h2>Optimization Analysis</h2>
<p>Optimization analysis is a process through which a firm estimates or determines the output level and maximizes its total profits. There are basically two approaches followed for optimization &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Total revenue and total cost approach</li>
<li>Marginal revenue and Marginal cost approach</li>
</ul>
<h2>Total Revenue and Total Cost Approach</h2>
<p>According to this approach, total profit is maximum at the level of output where the difference between the TR and TC is maximum.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>&Pi; = TR &minus; TC</b></p>
<p>When output = 0, TR = 0, but TC = $20, so total loss = $20</p>
<p>When output = 1, TR = $90, and TC = $140, so total loss = $50</p>
<p>At Q2, TR = TC = $160, therefore profit is equal to zero. When profit is equal to zero, it means that firm reached a breakeven point.</p>
<h2>Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost Approach</h2>
<p>As we have seen in TR and TC approach, profit is maximum when the difference between them is maximum. However, in case of marginal analysis, profit is maximum at a level of output when MR is equal to MC. Marginal cost is the change in total cost resulting from one unit change in output, whereas marginal revenue is the change in total revenue resulting from one unit change in sale.</p>
<p>According to marginal analysis, as long as marginal benefit of an activity is greater than marginal cost, it pays for an organization to increase the activity. The total net benefit is maximum when the MR equals the MC.</p>

<h1>Demand Forecasting</h1>

<h2>Demand</h2>
<p>Demand is a widely used term, and in common is considered synonymous with terms like ‘want’ or 'desire'. In economics, demand has a definite meaning which is different from ordinary use. In this chapter, we will explain what demand from the consumer’s point of view is and analyze demand from the firm perspective.</p> <p>Demand for a commodity in a market depends on the size of the market. Demand for a commodity entails the desire to acquire the product, willingness to pay for it along with the ability to pay for the same.</p>
<h2>Law of Demand</h2>
<p>The law of demand is one of the vital laws of economic theory. According to the law of demand, other things being equal, if the price of a commodity falls, the quantity demanded will rise and if the price of a commodity rises, its quantity demanded declines. Thus other things being constant, there is an inverse
relationship between the price and demand of commodities.</p>
<p>Things which are assumed to be constant are income of consumers, taste and preference, price of related commodities, etc., which may influence the demand. If these factors undergo change, then this law of demand may not hold good. </p>
<h3>Definition of Law of Demand</h3>
<p>According to Prof. Alfred Marshall “The greater the amount to be sold, the smaller must be the price at which it is offered in order that it may find purchase. Let’s have a look at an illustration to further understand the price and demand relationship assuming all other factors being constant &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Item</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Price (Rs.)</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Quantity Demanded (Units)</th>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>A</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>B</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>C</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>40</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>D</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>60</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center;">
<td>E</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>80</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In the above demand schedule, we can see when the price of commodity X is 10 per unit, the consumer purchases 15 units of the commodity. Similarly, when the price falls to 9 per unit, the quantity demanded increases to 20 units. Thus quantity demanded by the consumer goes on increasing until the price is lowest i.e. 6 per unit where the demand is 80 units.</p>
<p>The above demand schedule helps in depicting the inverse relationship between the price and quantity demanded. We can also refer the graph below to have more clear understanding of the same &minus;</p>
<p>We can see from the above graph, the demand curve is sloping downwards. It can be clearly seen that when the price of the commodity rises from P3 to P2, the quantity demanded comes down Q3 to Q2.</p>
<h2>Theory of Consumer Behavior</h2>
<p>The demand for a commodity depends on the utility of the consumer. If a consumer gets more satisfaction or utility from a particular commodity, he would pay a higher price too for the same and vice - versa.</p>
<p>In economics, all human motives, desires, and wishes are called wants. Wants may arise due to any cause. Since the resources are limited, we have to choose between urgent wants and not so urgent wants. In economics wants could be classified into following three categories &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Necessities</b> &minus; Necessities are those wants which are essential for living. The wants without which humans cannot do anything are necessities. For example, food, clothing and shelter.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Comforts</b> &minus; Comforts are the commodities which are not essential for our living but are required for a happy living. For example, buying a car, air travel.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Luxuries</b> &minus; Luxuries are those wants which are surplus and costly. They are not essential for our living but add efficiency to our lifestyle. For example, spending on designer clothes, fine wines, antique furniture, luxury chocolates, business air travel.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Marginal Utility Analysis</h2>
<p><b>Utility</b> is a term referring to the total satisfaction received from consuming a good or service. It differs from each individual and helps to show the satisfaction of the consumer after consumption of a commodity. In economics, utility is a measure of preferences over some set of goods and services.</p>
<p><b>Marginal Utility</b> is formulated by Alfred Marshall, a British economist. It is the additional benefit / utility derived from the consumption of an extra unit of a commodity.</p>
<p>Following are the assumptions of Marginal utility analysis &minus;</p>
<h3>Cardinal Measurability Concept</h3>
<p>This theory assumes that utility is a cardinal concept which means it is a measurable or quantifiable concept. This theory is quite helpful as it helps an individual to express his satisfaction in numbers by comparing different commodities.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; If an individual derives utility equals to 5 units from the consumption of 1 unit of commodity X and 15 units from the consumption of 1 unit of commodity Y, he can conveniently explain which commodity satisfies him more.</p>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>This assumption is a bit unreal which says the marginal utility of money remains constant throughout when the individual spending on a particular commodity. Marginal utility is measured with the following formula &minus;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">MU<Sub>nth</sub> = TU<sub>n</sub> &minus; TU<sub>n &minus; 1</sub></p>
<p>Where, MU<sub>nth</sub> &minus; Marginal utility of Nth unit.</p>
<p style="padding-left:6%;">TU<sub>n</sub> &minus; Total analysis of n units</p>
<p style="padding-left:6%;">TU<sub>n &minus; 1</sub> &minus; Total utility of n &minus; 1 units.</p>
<h2>Indifference Curve Analysis</h2>
<p>A very well accepted approach of explaining consumer’s demand is indifference curve analysis. As we all know that satisfaction of a human being cannot be measured in terms of money, so an approach which could be based on consumer preferences was found out as Indifference curve analysis.</p>
<p>Indifference curve analysis is based on the following few assumptions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It is assumed that the consumer is consistent in his consumption pattern. That means if he prefers a combination A to B and then B to C then he must prefer A to C for results.</p></li>
<li><p>Another assumption is that the consumer is capable enough of ranking the preferences according to his satisfaction level.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also assumed that the consumer is rational and has full knowledge about the economic environment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An indifference curve represents all those combinations of goods and services which provide same level of satisfaction to all the consumers. It means thus all the combinations provide same level of satisfaction, the consumers can prefe them equally.</p>
<p>A higher indifference curve signifies a higher level of satisfaction, so a consumer tries to consume as much as possible to achieve the desired level of indifference curve. The consumer to achieve it has to work under two constraints namely &minus; he has to pay the required price for the goods and also has to face the problem of limited money income.</p>
<p>The above graph highlights that the shape of the indifference curve is not a straight line. This is due to the concept of the diminishing marginal rate of substitution between the two goods.</p>
<h2>Consumer Equilibrium</h2>
<p>A consumer achieves the state of equilibrium when he gets maximum satisfaction from the goods and does not have to position the goods according to their satisfaction level. Consumer equilibrium is based on the following assumptions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Prices of the goods are fixed</p></li>
<li><p>Another assumption is that the consumer has fixed income which he has to spend on all the goods.</p></li>
<li><p>The consumer takes rational decisions to maximize his satisfaction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Consumer equilibrium is quite superior to utility analysis as consumer equilibrium takes into consideration more than one product at a time and it also does not assume constancy of money.</p>
<p>A consumer achieves equilibrium when as per his income and prices of the goods he consumes, he gets maximum satisfaction. That is, when he reaches highest indifference curve possible with his budget line.</p>
<p>In the figure below, the consumer is in equilibrium at point H when he consumes 100 units of food and purchases 5 units of clothing. The budget line AB is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve at point H.</p>
<p>The consumer is in equilibrium at point H. He is on the highest possible indifference curve given budgetary constraint and prices of two goods.</p>

<h1>Market Structure &amp; Pricing Decisions</h1>

<p>Price determination is one of the most crucial aspects in economics. Business managers are expected to make perfect decisions based on their knowledge and judgment. Since every economic activity in the market is measured as per price, it is important to know the concepts and theories related to pricing. Pricing discusses the rationale and assumptions behind pricing decisions. It analyzes unique market needs and discusses how business managers reach upon final pricing decisions.</p>
<p>It explains the equilibrium of a firm and is the interaction of the demand faced by the firm and its supply curve. The equilibrium condition differs under perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly. Time element is of great relevance in the theory of pricing since one of the two determinants of price, namely supply depends on the time allowed to it for adjustment.</p>
<h2>Market Structure</h2>
<p>A market is the area where buyers and sellers contact each other and exchange goods and services. Market structure is said to be the characteristics of the market. Market structures are basically the number of firms in the market that produce identical goods and services. Market structure influences the behavior of firms to a great extent. The market structure affects the supply of different commodities in the market.</p>
<p>When the competition is high there is a high supply of commodity as different companies try to dominate the markets and it also creates barriers to entry for the companies that intend to join that market. A monopoly market has the biggest level of barriers to entry while the perfectly competitive market has zero percent
level of barriers to entry. Firms are more efficient in a competitive market than in a monopoly structure.</p>
<h2>Perfect Competition</h2>
<p>Perfect competition is a situation prevailing in a market in which buyers and sellers are so numerous and well informed that all elements of monopoly are absent and the market price of a commodity is beyond the control of individual buyers and sellers</p>
<p>With many firms and a homogeneous product under perfect competition no individual firm is in a position to influence the price of the product that means price elasticity of demand for a single firm will be infinite.</p>
<h2>Pricing Decisions</h2>
<h3>Determinants of Price Under Perfect Competition</h3>
<p>Market price is determined by the equilibrium between demand and supply in a market period or very short run. The market period is a period in which the maximum that can be supplied is limited by the existing stock. The market period is so short that more cannot be produced in response to increased demand. The firms can sell only what they have already produced. This market period may be an hour, a day or a few days or even a few weeks depending upon the nature of the product.</p>
<h3>Market Price of a Perishable Commodity</h3>
<p>In the case of perishable commodity like fish, the supply is limited by the available quantity on that day. It cannot be stored for the next market period and therefore the whole of it must be sold away on the same day whatever the price may be.</p>
<h3>Market Price of Non-Perishable and Reproducible Goods</h3>
<p>In case of non-perishable but reproducible goods, some of the goods can be preserved or kept back from the market and carried over to the next market period. There will then be two critical price levels.</p>
<p>The first, if price is very high the seller will be prepared to sell the whole stock. The second level is set by a low price at which the seller would not sell any amount in the present market period, but will hold back the whole stock for some better time. The price below which the seller will refuse to sell is called the Reserve Price.</p>
<h2>Monopolistic Competition</h2>
<p>Monopolistic competition is a form of market structure in which a large number of independent firms are supplying products that are slightly differentiated from the point of view of buyers. Thus, the products of the competing firms are close but not perfect substitutes because buyers do not regard them as identical. This
situation arises when the same commodity is being sold under different brand names, each brand being slightly different from the others.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Lux, Liril, Dove, etc.</p>
<p>Each firm is therefore the sole producer of a particular brand or “product”. It is monopolist as far as a particular brand is concerned. However, since the various brands are close substitutes, a large number of “monopoly” producers of these brands are involved in a keen competition with one another. This type of market structure, where there is competition among a large number of “monopolists” is called monopolistic competition.</p>
<p>In addition to product differentiation, the other three basic characteristics of monopolistic competition are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>There are large number of independent sellers and buyers in the market.</p></li>
<li><p>The relative market shares of all sellers are insignificant and more or less equal. That is, seller-concentration in the market is almost non-existent.</p></li>
<li><p>There are neither any legal nor any economic barriers against the entry of new firms into the market. New firms are free to enter the market and existing firms are free to leave the market.</p></li>
<li><p>In other words, product differentiation is the only characteristic that distinguishes monopolistic competition from perfect competition.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Monopoly</h2>
<p>Monopoly is said to exist when one firm is the sole producer or seller of a product which has no close substitutes. According to this definition, there must be a single producer or seller of a product. If there are many producers producing a product, either perfect competition or monopolistic competition will prevail depending upon whether the product is homogeneous or differentiated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when there are few producers, oligopoly is said to exist. A second condition which is essential for a firm to be called monopolist is that no close substitutes for the product of that firm should be available.</p>
<p>From above it follows that for the monopoly to exist, following things are essential &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>One and only one firm produces and sells a particular commodity or a service.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no rivals or direct competitors of the firm.</p></li>
<li><p>No other seller can enter the market for whatever reasons legal, technical, or economic.</p></li>
<li><p>Monopolist is a price maker. He tries to take the best of whatever demand and cost conditions exist without the fear of new firms entering to compete away his profits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of market power applies to an individual enterprise or to a group of enterprises acting collectively. For the individual firm, it expresses the extent to which the firm has discretion over the price that it charges. The baseline of zero market power is set by the individual firm that produces and sells a homogeneous product alongside many other similar firms that all sell the same product.</p>
<p>Since all of the firms sell the identical product, the individual sellers are not distinctive. Buyers care solely about finding the seller with the lowest price.</p>
<p>In this context of “perfect competition”, all firms sell at an identical price that is equal to their marginal costs and no individual firm possess any market power. If any firm were to raise its price slightly above the market-determined price, it would lose all of its customers and if a firm were to reduce its price slightly below the market price, it would be swamped with customers who switch from the other firms.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the standard definition for market power is to define it as the divergence between price and marginal cost, expressed relative to price. In Mathematical terms we may define it as &minus;</p>

<h2>Oligopoly</h2>
<p>In an oligopolistic market there are small number of firms so that sellers are conscious of their interdependence. The competition is not perfect, yet the rivalry among firms is high. Given that there are large number of possible reactions of competitors, the behavior of firms may assume various forms. Thus there are various models of oligopolistic behavior, each based on different reactions patterns of rivals.</p>
<p>Oligopoly is a situation in which only a few firms are competing in the market for a particular commodity. The distinguishing characteristics of oligopoly are such that neither the theory of monopolistic competition nor the theory of monopoly can explain the behavior of an oligopolistic firm.</p>
<p>Two of the main characteristics of Oligopoly are briefly explained below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Under oligopoly the number of competing firms being small, each firm controls an important proportion of the total supply. Consequently, the effect of a change in the price or output of one firm upon the sales of its rival firms is noticeable and not insignificant. When any firm takes an action its rivals will in all probability react to it. The behavior of oligopolistic firms is interdependent and not independent or atomistic as is the case under perfect or monopolistic competition.</p></li>
<li><p>Under oligopoly new entry is difficult. It is neither free nor barred. Hence the condition of entry becomes an important factor determining the price or output decisions of oligopolistic firms and preventing or limiting entry of an important objective.</p></li>

<h1>Investment Under Certainty</h1>

<p>Capital Budgeting is the process by which the firm decides which long-term investments to make. Capital Budgeting projects, i.e., potential long-term investments, are expected to generate cash flows over several years.</p>
<p>Capital Budgeting also explains the decisions in which all the incomes and expenditures are covered. These decisions involve all inflows and outflows of funds of an undertaking for a particular period of time.</p>
<p>Capital Budgeting techniques under certainty can be divided into the following two groups &minus;</p>
<p><b>Non Discounted Cash Flow</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Pay Back Period</li>
<li>Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Discounted Cash Flow</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Net Present Value (NPV)</li>
<li>Profitability Index (PI)</li>
<li>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</li>
</ul>
<p>The payback period (PBP) is the traditional method of capital budgeting. It is the simplest and perhaps the most widely used quantitative method for appraising capital expenditure decision; i.e. it is the number of years required to recover the original cash outlay invested in a project.</p>
<h2>Non-Discounted Cash Flow</h2>
<p>Non-discounted cash flow techniques are also known as traditional techniques.</p>
<h3>Pay Back Period</h3>
<p>Payback period is one of the traditional methods of budgeting. It is widely used as quantitative method and is the simplest method in capital expenditure decision. Payback period helps in analyzing the number of years required to recover the original cash outlay invested in a particular project. The formula widely used to calculate payback period is &minus;</p>
<div style="text-align:center; class="eq-c">
PBP = 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Initial Investment</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Constant annual cash inflow</span>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Advantages of Using PBP</h3>
<p>PBP is a cost effective and easy to calculate method. It is simple to use and does not require much of the time for calculation. It is more helpful for short term earnings.</p>
<h3>Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)</h3>
<p>The ARR is the ratio after tax profit divided by the average investment. ARR is also known as return on investment method (ROI). Following formula is usually used to calculate ARR &minus;</p>
<div style="text-align:center; class="eq-c">
ARR = 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Average annual profit after tax</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Average investment</span>
</div>
&times;
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">100</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>The average profits after tax are obtained by adding up the profit after tax for each year and dividing the result by the number of years.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Using ARR</h3>
<p>ARR is simple to use and as it is based on accounting information, it is easily available. ARR is usually used as a performance evaluation measure and not as a decision making tool as it does not use cash flow information.</p>
<h2>Discounted Cash Flow Techniques</h2>
<p>Discounted cash flow techniques consider time value of money and are therefore also known as modern techniques.</p>
<h3>Net Present Value (NPV)</h3>
<p>The net present value is one of the discounted cash flow techniques. It is the difference between the present value of future cash inflows and the present value of the initial outlay, discounted at the firm’s cost of capital. It recognizes the cash flow streams at different time intervals and can be computed only when they are expressed in terms of common denominator (present value). Present value is calculated by determining an appropriate discount rate. NPV is calculated with the help of equation.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">NPV = Present value of cash inflows &minus; Initial investment.</p>
<p><b>Advantages</b></p>
<p>NPV is considered as the most appropriate measure of profitability. It considers all the years of cash flow, and recognizes the time value for money. It is an absolute measure of profitability that means it gives output in terms of absolute amount. The NPVs of the projects can be added together which is not possible in other methods.</p>
<h2>Profitability Index (PI)</h2>
<p>Profitability index method is also known as benefit cost ratio as numerator measures benefits and denominator measures cost like the NPV approach. It is the ratio obtained by dividing the present value of future cash inflows by the present value of cash outlays. Mathematically it is defined as &minus;</p>
<div style="text-align:center; class="eq-c">
PI = 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Present value of cash inflow</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Initial cash outlay</span>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p>In a capital rationing situation, PI is a better evaluation method as compared to NPV method. It considers the time value of money along cash flows generated by the project.</p>

<h2>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</h2>
<p>Internal rate of return is also known as yield on investment. IRR depends entirely on the initial outlay of the projects which are evaluated. It is the compound annual rate of return that the firm earns, if it invests in the project and receives the given cash inflows. Mathematically IRR is determined by the following equation &minus;</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p>IRR considers the total cash flows generated by a project over the life of the project. It measures profitability of the projects in percentage and can be easily compared with the opportunity cost of capital. It also considers the time value of money.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Investment Under Uncertainty</h1>

<p>Uncertainty is defined as a situation where there is a possibility of differing outcomes. For example, in an uncertain situation, the managers should evaluate the chance of difference in expected cash flows. They have to estimate whether the NV would be negative or the IRR would be less than the cost of capital.</p>
<h2>Statistical Techniques for Risk Analysis</h2>
<p>The following are the major statistical techniques used in risk analysis</p>
<h3>Probability Analysis</h3>
<p>Probability analysis is primarily defined as the possibility of occurrence of an event. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 (where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty).</p>
<h3>Expected Net Present Value</h3>
<p>Expected net present value can be found by multiplying the monetary values of the possible events by their probabilities. Following equation describes the expected net present value &minus;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;" class="eq-c">
ENPV = 
<span class="intsuma">
<span class="lim">n</span>
<span class="sum-frac">&sum;</span>
<span class="lim">t=0</span>
</span>
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">ENCF<sub>t</sub></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">(1 &plus; k)<sup>t</sup></span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Where, ENPV is the expected net present value. ENCFt is the expected net cash flows in period t and k is the discount rate.</p>
<h3>Standard Deviation</h3>
<p>Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the amount by which a set of values differs from the arithmetical mean, equal to the square root of the mean of the differences' squares. For example, a quantity expressing by how much the members of a group differ from the mean value for the group.</p>
<p>Risk analysis of capital budgeting decision is possible by calculating standard deviation and coefficient of variation. An important measure of risk analysis is standard deviation (&sigma;) and it can be used when projects under consideration have same cash outlay. Statically, standard deviation is the square root of variance and variance measures the deviation of the expected cash flow. The formula for calculating standard deviation will be as follows</p>
<p>$$\sigma \left ( X \right )\: = \sqrt{{\sum_{n = 1}^{N}} \: p_{N}\: \left ( CF_{N} - \overline{CF}\right )^{2}}$$</p>
<p>Where &minus;</p>
<p>&sigma; = Standard deviation</p>
<p>P = Probability of occurrence of cash flow</p>
<p>CF = Cash flow</p>
<h3>Coefficient of Variation</h3>
<p>Coefficient of variation involves the projects which are needed to be compared and involves different outlays. Following is the formula to calculate the coefficient of variation &minus;</p>
<div style="text-align:center; class="eq-c">
CV = 
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">Standard Deviation</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">Expected Value</span>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Normal Probability Distribution</h3>
<p>Risk in investment decision can be further analyzed by normal probability distribution. It helps the decision maker to have an idea of the probability of different expected values of NPV. For example, if the probability of having NPV zero or less is low, it means the risk in the project is negligible. Thus normal probability distribution is an important statistical technique for evaluating the risk in the business.</p>

<h1>Macroeconomics Basics</h1>

<p>Macroeconomics is a part of economic study which analyzes the economy as a whole. It is the average of the entire economy and does not study any individual unit or a firm. It studies the national income, total employment, aggregate demand and supply etc.</p>
<h2>Nature of Macroeconomics</h2>
<p>Macroeconomics is basically known as theory of income. It is concerned with the problems of economic fluctuations, unemployment, inflation or deflation and economic growth. It deals with the aggregates of all quantities not with individual price levels or outputs but with national output.</p>
<p>As per G. Ackley, Macroeconomics concerns itself with such variables &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Aggregate volume of the output of an economy</li>
<li>Extent to which resources are employed</li>
<li>Size of the national income</li>
<li>General price level</li>
</ul>
<h3>Working of the Economy</h3>
<p>The study of macroeconomics is crucial to understand the working of an economy. Economic problems are mainly related to the employment, behavior of total income and general price in the economy. Macroeconomics help in making the elimination process more understandable.</p>
<h3>In Economy Policies</h3>
<p>Macroeconomics is very useful in an economic policy. Underdeveloped economies face innumerable problems related to overpopulation, inflation, balance of payments etc. The main responsibilities of government are controlling the overpopulation, prices, volume of trade etc.</p>
<p>Following are the economic problems where macroeconomics study are useful &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>In national income</li>
<li>In unemployment</li>
<li>In economic growth</li>
<li>In monetary problems</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding the Behavior of Individual Units</h3>
<p>The demand for individual products depends upon aggregate demand in the economy therefore understanding the behavior of individual units is very important in macroeconomics. Firstly, to solve the problem of deficiency in
demand of individual products, understanding the causes of fall in aggregate demand is required. Similarly to know the reasons for increase in costs of a particular firm or industry, it is first required to understand the average cost conditions of the whole economy. Thus, the study of individual units is not possible without macroeconomics.</p>
<p>Macroeconomics enhances our knowledge of the functioning of an economy by studying the behavior of national income, output, savings, and consumptions.</p>

<h1>National Income Determination</h1>

<h2>Factors Determining the National Income</h2>
<p>According to Keynes there are two major factors that determine the national income of an economy &minus;</p>
<h3>Aggregate Supply</h3>
<p>Aggregate supply comprises of consumer goods as well as producer goods. It is defined as total value of goods and services produced and supplied at a particular point of time. When goods and services produced at a particular point of time is multiplied by the respective prices of goods and services, it helps us in getting the total value of the national output. The formula for determining the aggregate national income is follows &minus;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">Aggregate Income = Consumption(C) &plus; Saving (S)</p>
<p>Few factor prices such as wages, rents are rigid in the short run. When demand in an economy increases, firms also tend to increase production to some extent. However, along with the production, some factor prices and the amount of inputs needed to increase production also increase.</p>
<h3>Aggregate Demand</h3>
<p>Aggregate demand is the effective aggregate expenditure of an economy in a particular time period. It is the effective demand which is equal to the actual expenditure. Aggregate demand involves concepts namely aggregate demand for consumer goods and aggregate demand for capital goods. Aggregate demand can be represented by the following formula &minus;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">AD = C &plus; I</p>
<p>As per Keynes theory of nation income, investment (I) remains constant throughout, while consumption (C) keeps changing, and thus consumption is the major determinant of income.</p>
